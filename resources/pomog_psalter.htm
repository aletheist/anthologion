<h1>Psalms</h1>

<h2>Psalm 1</h2>
<p><small>1:1 </small>Blessed is the man who has not walked 
in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners, and has 
not sat in the seat of evil men. <small>2 </small>
But his pleasure is in the law of the Lord; and in his law will he meditate day 
and night. <small>3 </small>And he shall be as a 
tree planted by the brooks of waters, which shall yield its fruit in its season, 
and its leaf shall not fall off; and whatsoever he shall do shall be prospered.</p>

<p><small>4 </small>Not so the ungodly; —not so: but 
rather as the chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth.
<small>5 </small>Therefore the ungodly shall not 
rise in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the just. <small>
6 </small>For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but the way 
of the ungodly shall perish.</p>

<h2>Psalm 2</h2>
<p><small>2:1 </small>Wherefore did the heathen rage, and 
the nations imagine vain things? <small>2 </small>
The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered themselves together, 
against the Lord, and against his Christ; <small>3 </small>
<i>saying</i>, Let us break through their bonds, and cast away 
their yoke from us. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>He that dwells 
in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall mock them. <small>5 </small>Then shall he speak to them in his anger, 
and trouble them in his fury. <small>6 </small>But 
I have been made king by him on Sion his holy mountain,
<small>7 </small>declaring the ordinance of the Lord: 
the Lord said to me, Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee. <small>8 </small>Ask of me, and I will give thee the 
heathen <i>for</i> thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth <i>for</i> thy 
possession. <small>9 </small>Thou shalt rule them 
with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces as a potter’s vessel.</p>

<p><small>10 </small>Now therefore understand, ye kings: 
be instructed, all ye that judge the earth. <small>11 </small>
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling.
<small>12 </small>Accept correction, lest at any 
time the Lord be angry, and ye should perish from the righteous way: whensoever 
his wrath shall be suddenly kindled, blessed are all they that trust in him.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Psalm 3</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of his son 
Abessalom. </h4>
<p><small>3:1 </small>O Lord, why are they that afflict me 
multiplied? many rise up against me. <small>2 </small>
Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance for him in 
his God. Pause. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>But thou, O Lord, 
art my helper: my glory, and the one that lifts up my head.
<small>4 </small>I cried to the Lord with my voice, and 
he heard me out of his holy mountain. Pause. <small>5 </small>
I lay down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord will help me. <small>6 </small>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of 
people, who beset me round about. <small>7 </small>
Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: for thou hast smitten all who were without 
cause mine enemies; thou hast broken the teeth of sinners. <small>8 </small>Deliverance is the Lord’s, and thy 
blessing is upon thy people.</p>

<h2>Psalm 4</h2>
<h4>For the End, a Song of David among <i>the</i> Psalms.</h4>
<p><small>4:1 </small>When I called upon <i>him</i>, the 
God of my righteousness heard me: thou hast made room for me in tribulation; 
pity me, and hearken to my prayer. </p>
<p><small>2 </small>
O ye sons on men, how long <i>will ye be</i> slow of heart? 
wherefore do ye love vanity, and seek falsehood? Pause. <small>3
</small>But know ye that the Lord has done wondrous things for his 
holy one: the Lord will hear me when I cry to him. <small>4
</small>Be ye angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon your beds 
for what ye say in your hearts. Pause. <small>5 </small>
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>Many say, Who will shew us good 
things? the light of thy countenance, O Lord, has been manifested towards us.
<small>7 </small>Thou hast put gladness into my 
heart: they have been satisfied with the fruit of their corn and wine and oil.
<small>8 </small>I will both lie down in peace and 
sleep: for thou, Lord, only hast caused me to dwell securely.</p>

<h2>Psalm 5</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning her that inherits.</h4>
<p><small>5:1 </small>Hearken to my words, O Lord, attend 
to my cry. <small>2 </small>Attend to the voice of 
my supplication, my King, and my God: for to thee, O Lord, will I pray. <small>3 </small>In the morning thou shalt hear my voice: 
in the morning will I wait upon thee, and will look up. <small>4
</small>For thou art not a god that desires iniquity; neither 
shall the worker of wickedness dwell with thee. <small>5 </small>
Neither shall the transgressors continue in thy sight: thou 
hatest, O Lord, all them that work iniquity. <small>6 </small>
Thou wilt destroy all that speak falsehood: the Lord abhors the 
bloody and deceitful man.
<small>7 </small>But I will enter into thine house in 
the multitude of thy mercy: I will worship in thy fear toward thy holy temple.
</p>
<p><small>8 </small>Lead me, O Lord, in thy 
righteousness because of mine enemies; make my way plain before thy face. <small>9 </small>For there is no truth in their mouth; 
their heart is vain; their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they 
have used deceit. <small>10 </small>Judge them, O 
God; let them fail of their counsels: cast them out according to the abundance 
of their ungodliness; for they have provoked thee, O Lord. </p>
<p>
<small>11 </small>But let all that trust on thee be glad 
in thee: they shall exult for ever, and thou shalt dwell among them; and all 
that love thy name shall rejoice in thee. <small>12 </small>
For thou, Lord, shalt bless the righteous: thou hast compassed us 
as with a shield of favour.</p>

<h2>Psalm 6</h2>
<h4>For the End, a Psalm of David among the Hymns for the eighth.</h4>
<p><small>6:1 </small>O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, 
neither chasten me in thine anger. <small>2 </small>
Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord; for my bones are 
vexed. <small>3 </small>My soul also is grievously 
vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? <small>4 </small>
Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy’s sake.
<small>5 </small>For in death no man remembers 
thee: and who will give thee thanks in Hades? <small>6 </small>
I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I 
shall water my couch with tears. <small>7 </small>
Mine eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am worn out because of all my 
enemies.</p>

<p><small>8 </small>Depart from me, all ye that work 
iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. <small>
9 </small>The Lord has hearkened to my petition; the Lord has 
accepted my prayer. <small>10 </small>Let all mine 
enemies be put to shame and sore troubled: let them be turned back and 
grievously put to shame speedily.</p>

<h2>Psalm 7</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words 
of Chusi the Benjamite.</h4>
<p><small>7:1 </small>O Lord my God, in thee have I 
trusted: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. <small>2 </small>Lest at any time <i>the enemy</i> seize 
my soul as a lion, while there is none to ransom, nor to save. </p>
<p>
<small>3 </small>O Lord my God, if I have done this; (if 
there is unrighteousness in my hands;) <small>4 </small>
if I have requited with evil those who requited me <i>with good</i>; 
may I then perish empty by means of my enemies. <small>5 </small>
Let the enemy persecute my soul, an take it; and let him trample 
my life on the ground, and lay my glory in the dust. Pause. </p>
<p>
<small>6 </small>Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath; be exalted 
in the utmost boundaries of mine enemies: awake, O Lord my God, according to the 
decree which thou didst command. <small>7 </small>
And the congregation of the nations shall compass thee: and for this cause do 
thou return on high. <small>8 </small>The Lord 
shall judge the nations: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and 
according to my innocence that is in me. <small>9 </small>
Oh let the wickedness of sinners come to an end; and <i>then</i> 
thou shalt direct the righteous, O God that searchest the hearts and reins.</p>

<p><small>10 </small>My help is righteous, <i>coming</i> 
from God who saves the upright in heart. <small>11 </small>
God is a righteous judge, and strong, and patient, not inflicting 
vengeance every day. <small>12 </small>If ye will 
not repent, he will furbish his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready.
<small>13 </small>And on it he has fitted the 
instruments of death; he has completed his arrows for the raging ones. </p>
<p>
<small>14 </small>Behold, he has travailed with 
unrighteousness, he has conceived trouble, and brought forth iniquity. <small>15 </small>He has opened a pit, and dug it up, and 
he shall fall into the ditch which he has made. <small>16 </small>
His trouble shall return on his own head, and his unrighteousness 
shall come down on his own crown. <small>17 </small>
I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness; I 
will sing to the name of the Lord most high.</p>

<h2>Psalm 8</h2>
<h4>For the end, concerning the wine-presses, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>8:1 </small>O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is 
thy name in all the earth! for thy magnificence is exalted above the heavens.
<small>2 </small>Out of the mouth of babes and 
sucklings hast thou perfected praise, because of thine enemies; that thou 
mightest put down the enemy and avenger.</p>

<p><small>3 </small>For I will regard the heavens, the 
work of thy fingers; the moon and stars, which thou hast established. <small>4 </small>What is man, that thou art mindful of 
him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? <small>5 </small>
Thou madest him a little less than angels, thou hast crowned him 
with glory and honour; <small>6 </small>and thou 
hast set him over the works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his 
feet: <small>7 </small>sheep and all oxen, yea and 
the cattle of the field; <small>8 </small>the birds 
of the sky, and the fish of the sea, the <i>creatures</i> passing through the 
paths of the sea. <small>9 </small>O Lord our Lord, 
how wonderful is thy name in all the earth!</p>

<h2>Psalm 9</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning the secrets of the Son.</h4>
<p><small>9:1 </small>I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, 
with my whole heart; I will recount all thy wonderful works. <small>2 </small>I will be glad and exult in thee: I will 
sing to thy name, O thou Most High. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>
When mine enemies are turned back, they shall be feeble and 
perish at thy presence. <small>4 </small>For thou 
hast maintained my cause and my right; thou satest on the throne, that judgest 
righteousness. <small>5 </small>Thou hast rebuked 
the nations, and the ungodly one has perished; thou hast blotted out their name 
for ever, even for ever and ever. <small>6 </small>
The swords of the enemy have failed utterly; and thou hast destroyed cities: 
their memorial has been destroyed with a noise, <small>7 </small>
but the Lord endures for ever: he has prepared his throne for 
judgment. <small>8 </small>And he will judge the 
world in righteousness, he will judge the nations in uprightness. <small>9 </small>The Lord also is become a refuge for the 
poor, a seasonable help, in affliction. <small>10 </small>
And let them that know thy name hope in thee: for thou, O Lord, 
hast not failed them that diligently seek thee.</p>

<p><small>11 </small>Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells 
in Sion: declare his dealings among the nations. <small>12 </small>
For he remembered them, <i>in</i> making inquisition for blood: 
he has not forgotten the supplication of the poor. </p>
<p><small>13
</small>Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon my affliction <i>
which I suffer</i> of mine enemies, thou that liftest me up from the gates of 
death: <small>14 </small>that I may declare all thy 
praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion: I will exult in thy salvation.
</p>
<p><small>15 </small>The heathen are caught in the 
destruction which they planned: in the very snare which they hid is their foot 
taken. <small>16 </small>The Lord is known as 
executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his hands. A song of 
Pause. <small>17 </small>Let sinners be driven away 
into Hades, <i>even</i> all the nations that forget God. <small>
18 </small>For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the 
patience of the needy ones shall not perish for ever. <small>19
</small>Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the heathen be 
judged before thee. <small>20 </small>Appoint, O 
Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are men. Pause.</p>

<h2>Psalm 10</h2>
<p><small>10:1 </small>Why standest thou afar off, O Lord?
<i>why</i> dost thou overlook <i>us</i> in times of need, in affliction? <small>2 </small>While the ungodly one acts proudly, the 
poor is hotly pursued: <i>the wicked</i> are taken in the crafty counsels which 
they imagine. <small>3 </small>Because the sinner 
praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses 
himself. <small>4 </small>The sinner has provoked 
the Lord: according to the abundance of his pride he will not seek after <i>him</i>: 
God is not before him. <small>5 </small>His ways 
are profane at all times; thy judgments are removed from before him: he will 
gain the mastery over all his enemies. <small>6 </small>
For he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, <i>continuing</i> 
without evil from generation to generation. <small>7 </small>
Whose mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and fraud: under 
his tongue are trouble and pain. <small>8 </small>
He lies in wait with rich <i>men</i> in secret places, in order to slay the 
innocent: his eyes are set against the poor. <small>9 </small>
He lies in wait in secret as a lion in his den: he lies in wait 
to ravish the poor, to ravish the poor when he draws him <i>after him</i>: he 
will bring him down in his snare. <small>10 </small>
He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor. <small>11 </small>For he has said in his heart, God has 
forgotten: he has turned away his face so as never to look.</p>

<p><small>12 </small>Arise, O Lord God; let thy hand be 
lifted up: forget not the poor. <small>13 </small>
Wherefore, has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, He will 
not require <i>it</i>. <small>14 </small>Thou seest
<i>it</i>; for thou dost observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into thy 
hands: the poor has been left to thee; thou wast a helper to the orphan. <small>15 </small>Break thou the arm of the sinner and 
wicked man: his sin shall be sought for, and shall not be found. </p>
<p>
<small>16 </small>The Lord shall reign for ever, even for 
ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish out his land. <small>17
</small>The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: thine ear has 
inclined to the preparation of their heart; <small>18 </small>
to plead for the orphan and afflicted, that man may no more boast 
upon the earth.</p>

<h2>Psalm 11</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>11:1 </small>In the Lord I have put my trust: 
how will ye say to my soul, Flee to the mountains as a sparrow? <small>2 </small>For behold the sinners have bent their <i>
bow</i>, they have prepared their arrows for the quiver, to shoot privily at the 
upright in heart. <small>3 </small>For they have 
pulled down what thou didst frame, but what has the righteous done?
</p>
<p><small>4 </small>The Lord is in his holy temple, as for 
the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try 
the sons of men. <small>5 </small>The Lord tries 
the righteous and the ungodly: and he that loves unrighteousness hates his own 
soul. <small>6 </small>He shall rain upon sinners 
snares, fire, and brimstone, and a stormy blast <i>shall be</i> the portion of 
their cup. <small>7 </small>For the Lord <i>is</i> 
righteous, and loves righteousness; his face beholds uprightness.</p>

<h2>Psalm 12</h2>
<h4>For the end, A Psalm of David, upon the eighth.</h4>
<p><small>12:1 </small>Save me, O Lord; for the godly man 
has failed; for truth is diminished from among the children of men. <small>2 </small>Every one has spoken vanity to his 
neighbour: their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart.
<small>3 </small>Let the Lord destroy all the 
deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks great words: <small>4
</small>who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are 
our own: who is Lord of us? </p>
<p><small>5 </small>
Because of the misery of the poor, and because of the sighing of the needy, now 
will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set <i>them</i> in safety; I will speak <i>
to them</i> thereof openly. <small>6 </small>The 
oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved <i>in</i> 
a furnace of earth, purified seven times. <small>7 </small>
Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, and shalt preserve us, from this 
generation, and for ever. <small>8 </small>The 
ungodly walk around: according to thy greatness thou has greatly exalted the 
sons of men.</p>

<h2>Psalm 13</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>13:1 </small>How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget 
me? for ever? how long wilt thou turn away thy face from me? <small>2 </small>How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
<i>having</i> sorrows in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over 
me? <small>3 </small>Look on me, hearken to me, O 
Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death; <small>4
</small>lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against 
him: my persecutors will exult if ever I should be moved. </p>
<p><small>
5 </small>But I have hoped in thy mercy; my heart shall exult in 
thy salvation. <small>6 </small>I will sing to the 
Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing psalms to the name of 
the Lord most high.</p>

<h2>Psalm 14</h2>
<h4>For the end, Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>14:1 </small>The fool has said in his heart, 
There is no God. They have corrupted <i>themselves</i>, and become abominable in 
their devices; there is none that does goodness, there is not even so much as 
one. <small>2 </small>The Lord looked down from 
heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought 
after god. <small>3 </small>They are all gone out 
of the way, they are together become good for nothing, there is none that does 
good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they 
have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of 
cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and 
misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no 
fear of God before their eyes.</p>

<p><small>4 </small>Will not all the workers of iniquity 
know, who eat up my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon 
the Lord. <small>5 </small>There were they alarmed 
with fear, where there was no fear; for God is in the righteous generation.
<small>6 </small>Ye have shamed the counsel of the 
poor, because the Lord is his hope. <small>7 </small>
Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? when the Lord 
brings back the captivity of his people, let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad.</p>

<h2>Psalm 15</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>15:1 </small> O Lord, who shall sojourn in 
thy tabernacle? and who shall dwell in thy holy mountain? </p>
<p><small>
2 </small>He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, who 
speaks truth in his heart. <small>3 </small>Who has 
not spoken craftily with is tongue, neither has done evil to his neighbour, nor 
taken up a reproach against them that dwelt nearest to him. <small>4 </small>In his sight an evil-worker is set at 
nought, but he honours them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbour, and 
disappoints <i>him</i> not. <small>5 </small>He has 
not lent his money on usury, and has not received bribes against the innocent. 
He that does these things shall never be moved.</p>

<h2>Psalm 16</h2>
<h4>A writing of David.</h4>
<p><small>16:1 </small>Keep me, O Lord; for I have hoped 
in thee. <small>2</small> I said to the Lord, Thou 
art my Lord; for thou has no need of my goodness. <small>3 </small>
On behalf of the saints that are in his land, he has magnified 
all his pleasure in them. <small>4 </small>Their 
weaknesses have been multiplied; afterward they hasted. I will by no means 
assemble their bloody meetings, neither will I make mention of their names with 
my lips. <small>5 </small>The Lord is the portion 
of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou art he that restores my inheritance to 
me. <small>6 </small>The lines have fallen to me in 
the best places, yea, I have a most excellent heritage. </p>
<p><small>7
</small>I will bless the Lord who has instructed me; my reins too 
have chastened me even till night.
<small>8 </small>I foresaw the Lord always before my 
face; for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. <small>9 </small>Therefore my heart rejoiced an my tongue 
exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: <small>10
</small>because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt 
thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. <small>11 </small>
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me 
with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand <i>there are</i> delights for 
ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 17</h2>
<h4>A prayer of David.</h4>
<p><small>17:1 </small>Hearken, O Lord of my 
righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not <i>uttered</i> 
with deceitful lips. <small>2 </small>Let my 
judgment come forth from thy presence; let mine eyes behold righteousness.
<small>3 </small>Thou has proved mine heart; thou 
hast visited <i>me</i> by night; thou hast tried me as with fire, and 
unrighteousness has not been found in me: <i>I am purposed</i> that my mouth 
shall not speak <i>amiss</i>. <small>4 </small>As 
for the works of men, by the words of thy lips I have guarded <i>myself from</i> 
hard ways. <small>5 </small>Direct my steps in thy 
paths, that my steps slip not. </p>
<p><small>6 </small>I 
have cried, for thou heardest me, O God: incline thine ear to me, and hearken to 
my words. <small>7 </small>Shew the marvels of thy 
mercies, thou that savest them that hope in thee.
<small>8 </small>Keep me as the apple of the eye from 
those that resist thy right hand: thou shalt screen me by the covering of thy 
wings, <small>9 </small>from the face of the 
ungodly that have afflicted me: mine enemies have compassed about my soul.
<small>10 </small>They have enclosed <i>themselves 
with</i> their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride. <small>11
</small>They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: 
they have set their eyes <i>so as</i> to bow them down to the ground. <small>12 </small>They laid wait for me as a lion ready 
for prey, and like a lion’s whelp dwelling in secret <i>places</i>. <small>13 </small>Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast 
them down: deliver my soul from the ungodly: <i>draw</i> thy sword, <small>14 </small>because of the enemies of thine hand: O 
Lord, destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life, though their 
belly has been filled with thy hidden <i>treasures</i>: they have been satisfied 
with uncleanness, and have left the remnant <i>of their possessions</i> to their 
babes. </p>
<p><small>15 </small>But I shall appear in 
righteousness before thy face: I shall be satisfied when thy glory appears.</p>

<h2>Psalm 18</h2>
<h4>For the end, <i>a Psalm</i> of David, the servant of the Lord; <i>
the words</i> which he spoke to the Lord, <i>even</i> the words of this Song, in 
the day in which the Lord delivered him out the hand of all his enemies, and out 
the hand of Saul: and he said:</h4>
<p><small>18:1 </small>I will love thee, O Lord, my 
strength. <small>2 </small>The Lord is my firm 
support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in 
him; <i>he is</i> my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper.
<small>3 </small>I will call upon the Lord with 
praises, and I shall be saved from mine enemies. <small>4 </small>
The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness 
troubled me exceedingly. <small>5 </small>The pangs 
of hell came round about me: the snares of death prevented me. </p>
<p>
<small>6 </small>And when I was afflicted I called upon 
the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple, and my 
cry shall enter before him, <i>even</i> into his ears. </p>
<p><small>7
</small>Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of 
the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them.
<small>8 </small>There went up a smoke in his 
wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it.
<small>9 </small>And he bowed the heaven, and came 
down: and thick darkness was under his feet. <small>10 </small>
And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of 
winds. <small>11 </small>And he made darkness his 
secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, <i>even</i> dark water in the 
clouds of the air. <small>12 </small>At the 
brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. <small>13 </small>The Lord also thundered from heaven, and 
the Highest uttered his voice. <small>14 </small>
And he sent forth <i>his</i> weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied 
lightnings, and routed them. <small>15 </small>And 
the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, 
at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy wrath. </p>
<p>
<small>16 </small>He sent from on high and took me, he 
drew me to himself out of many waters. <small>17 </small>
He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that 
hate me; for they are stronger than I. <small>18 </small>
They prevented me in the day of mine affliction: but the Lord was 
my stay against <i>them</i>. <small>19 </small>And 
he brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure 
in me.<small> 20 </small>And the Lord will recompense me 
according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he 
recompense me. <small>21 </small>For I have kept 
the way of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God. <small>22 </small>For all his judgments were before me, 
and his ordinances departed not from me. <small>23 </small>
And I shall be blameless with hem, and shall keep myself from 
mine iniquity. <small>24 </small>And the Lord shall 
recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my 
hands before his eyes. </p>
<p><small>25 </small>With the 
holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent. <small>26 </small>And with the excellent <i>man</i> thou 
wilt be excellent; and with the perverse thou wilt shew frowardness. <small>27 </small>For thou wilt save the lowly people, and 
wilt humble the eyes of the proud. <small>28 </small>
For thou, O Lord, wilt light my lamp: my God, thou wilt lighten 
my darkness.
<small>29 </small>For by thee shall I be delivered from 
a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall. <small>30 </small>
<i>As for</i> my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord 
are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all them that hope in him. <small>31 </small>For who is God but the Lord? and who is 
a God except our God? </p>
<p><small>32 </small><i>It is</i> 
God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless: <small>33 </small>who strengthens my feet as hart’s feet, 
and sets me upon high places. <small>34 </small>He 
instructs my hands for war: and thou hast made my arms <i>as</i> a brazen bow.
<small>35 </small>And thou hast made me secure in 
my salvation: and thy right hand has helped me, and thy correction has upheld me 
to the end; yea, thy correction itself shall instruct me. <small>
36 </small>Thou has made room for my goings under me, and by 
footsteps did not fail. <small>37 </small>I will 
pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are 
consumed. <small>38 </small>I will dash them to 
pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet.
<small>39 </small>For thou hast girded me with 
strength for war: thou hast beaten down under me all that rose up against me.
<small>40 </small>And thou has made mine enemies 
turn their backs before me; and thou hast destroyed them that hated me. <small>41 </small>They cried, but there was no deliverer:
<i>even</i> to the Lord, but he hearkened not to them. <small>42
</small>I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will 
beat them small as dust before the wind. <small>43 </small>
Deliver me from the gain sayings of the people: thou shalt make 
me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me, <small>44 </small>at the hearing of the ear they obeyed 
me: the strange children lied to me. <small>45 </small>
The strange children waxed old, and fell away from their paths 
through lameness. </p>
<p><small>46 </small>The Lord lives; 
and blessed <i>be</i> my God; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. <small>47 </small><i>It is</i> God that avenges me, and 
has subdued the nations under me; <small>48 </small>
my deliverer from angry enemies: thou shalt set me on high above 
them that rise up against me: thou shalt deliver me from the unrighteous man.
<small>49 </small>Therefore will I confess to thee, 
O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name. <small>50
</small><i>God</i> magnifies the deliverances of his king; and 
deals mercifully with David his anointed, and his seed, for ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 19</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>19:1 </small>The heavens declare the glory of 
God; and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. <small>2 </small>
Day to day utters speech, and night to night proclaims knowledge. <small>3 </small>There are no speeches or words, in which 
their voices are not heard. <small>4 </small>
Their voice is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the 
world. <small>5 </small>In the sun he has set his 
tabernacle; and he comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber: he will exult 
as a giant to run his course. <small>6 </small>
His going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and his 
circuit to the <i>other</i> end of heaven: and no one shall be hidden from his 
heat.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>The law of the Lord is perfect, 
converting souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, instructing babes. <small>8 </small>
The ordinances of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of 
the Lord is bright, enlightening the eyes. <small>9 </small>The 
fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever and ever: the judgments of the Lord 
are true, <i>and</i> justified altogether. <small>10 </small>
To be desired more than gold, and much precious stone: sweeter 
also than honey and the honey-comb. <small>11 </small>
For thy servant keeps to them: in the keeping of them <i>
there is</i> great reward. </p>
<p><small>12 </small>
Who will understand <i>his</i> transgressions? purge thou me from my 
secret <i>sins</i>. <small>13 </small>And 
spare thy servant <i>the attack</i> of strangers: if they do not gain the 
dominion over me, then shall I be blameless, and I shall be clear from great 
sin. <small>14 </small>So shall the sayings of my 
mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be pleasing continually before thee, O 
Lord my helper, and my redeemer.</p>

<h2>Psalm 20</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>20:1 </small>The Lord hear thee in the day of 
trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee. <small>2 </small>Send thee help 
from the sanctuary, and aid thee out of Sion. <small>3 </small>
Remember all thy sacrifice, and enrich thy whole-burnt-offering. 
Pause. <small>4 </small>
Grant thee according to thy heart, and fulfill all thy desire. <small>5 </small>We will exult in thy salvation, 
and in the name of our God shall we be magnified: the Lord fulfil all thy 
petitions.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>Now I know that the Lord has saved his 
Christ: he shall hear him from his holy heaven: the salvation of his right hand 
is mighty. <small>7 </small>Some
<i>glory</i> in chariots, and some in horses: but we will glory in the name of 
the Lord our God. <small>8 </small>They are 
overthrown and fallen: but we are risen, and have been set upright. <small>9 </small>O Lord, save the king: and hear us in 
whatever day we call upon thee.</p>
<h2>Psalm 21</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>21:1 </small>O Lord, the king shall rejoice in 
thy strength; and in thy salvation he shall greatly exult. <small>2 </small>
Thou hast granted him the desire of his soul, and hast not withheld from him the 
request of his lips. Pause. <small>3 </small>For 
thou hast prevented him with blessings of goodness: thou has set upon his head a 
crown of precious stone. <small>4 </small>
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him length of days for ever and 
ever. <small>5 </small>His glory is great in thy 
salvation: thou wilt crown him with glory and majesty. <small>6 </small>For thou wilt give him a blessing for 
ever and ever: thou wilt gladden him with joy with thy countenance.
<small>7 </small>For the king trusts in the Lord, and 
through the mercy of the Highest he shall not be moved. </p>
<p>
<small>8 </small>Let thy hand be found by all thine 
enemies: let thy right hand find all that hate thee. <small>9
</small>Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven at the time of 
thy presence: the Lord shall trouble them in his anger, and fire shall devour 
them. <small>10 </small>Thou shalt destroy 
their fruit from the earth, and their seed from <i>among</i> the sons of men.
<small>11 </small>For they intended evils against 
thee; they imagined a device which they shall by no means be able to perform. <small>12 </small>For thou shalt 
make them <i>turn their</i> back in thy latter end, thou wilt prepare their 
face. <small>13 </small>Be thou exalted, O Lord, in 
thy strength: we will sing and praise thy mighty acts.</p>

<h2>Psalm 22</h2>
<h4>For the end, concerning the 
morning aid, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>22:1 </small>O God, my God, attend to me: why 
hast thou forsaken me? the account of my transgressions is far from my 
salvation. <small>2 </small>O my God, I will cry to thee by 
day, but thou wilt not hear: and by night, and <i>it shall</i> not <i>be 
accounted</i> for folly to me. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>
But thou, the praise of Israel, dwellest in a sanctuary. <small>4 </small>Our fathers hoped in thee; they hoped, 
and thou didst deliver them. <small>5 </small>
They cried to thee, and were saved: they hoped in thee, and were 
not ashamed. <small>6 </small>But I am a worm, and 
not a man; a reproach of men, and scorn of the people. <small>7 </small>All that saw me mocked me: they 
spoke with <i>their</i> lips, they shook the head, <i>saying</i>, <small>8 </small>He hoped in the Lord: let him deliver 
him, let him save him, because he takes pleasure in him. <small>9 </small>For thou art he that drew me out of the 
womb; my hope from my mother’s breasts. <small>10 </small>
I was cast on thee from the womb: thou art my God from my 
mother’s belly.</p>

<p><small>11 </small>Stand not aloof from me; for 
affliction is near; for there is no helper. <small>12 </small>
Many bullocks have compassed me: fat bulls have beset me round. <small>13</small>They 
have opened their mouth against me, as a ravening and roaring lion. <small>14
</small>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are loosened: 
my heart in the midst of my belly is become like melting wax. <small>15 </small>My strength is dried up, like a 
potsherd; and my tongue is glued to my throat; and thou hast brought me down to 
the dust of death. <small>16 </small>For many dogs 
have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked doers has beset me round: they 
pierced my hands and my feet. <small>17 </small>
They counted all my bones; and they observed and looked upon me. <small>18 </small>They parted my 
garments <i>among</i> themselves, and cast lots upon my raiment. </p>
<p>
<small>19 </small>But thou, O Lord, remove not my help 
afar off: be ready for mine aid. <small>20 </small>
Deliver my soul from the sword; my only-begotten one from the 
power of the dog. <small>21 </small>Save me from the lion’s mouth; and <i>regard</i> my lowliness from the horns of 
the unicorns.</p>

<p><small>22 </small>I will declare thy name to my 
brethren: in the midst of the church will I sing praise to thee. <small>23 </small>Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all 
ye seed of Jacob, glorify him: let all the seed of Israel fear him.
<small>24 </small>For he has not despised nor been 
angry at the supplication of the poor; nor turned away his face from me; but 
when I cried to him, he heard me. <small>25 </small>
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my 
vows before them that fear him. </p>
<p><small>26 </small>
The poor shall eat and be satisfied; and they shall praise the 
Lord that seek him: their heart shall live for ever. <small>27 </small>All the ends of the earth shall 
remember and turn to the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship 
before him. <small>28 </small>For the kingdom is 
the Lord’s; and he is the governor of the nations. <small>29 </small>All the fat ones of the earth have eaten 
and worshipped: all that go down to the earth shall fall down before him: my 
soul also lives to him. <small>30 </small>
And my seed shall serve him: the generation that is coming shall be reported to 
the Lord. <small>31 </small>And they shall report 
his righteousness to the people that shall be born, whom the Lord has made.</p>
<h2>Psalm 23</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>23:1 </small>The Lord tends me as a shepherd, 
and I shall want nothing. <small>2
</small>In a place of green grass, there he has made me dwell: he 
has nourished me by the water of rest. <small>3 </small>
He has restored my soul: he has guided me into the paths of 
righteousness, for his name’s sake. <small>4 </small>
Yea, even if I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I 
will not be afraid of evils: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, these 
have comforted me. <small>5 </small>
Thou has prepared a table before me in presence of them that afflict me: 
thou hast thoroughly anointed my head with oil; and thy cup cheers me like the 
best <i>wine</i>. <small>6 </small>Thy mercy 
also shall follow me all the days of my life: and my dwelling <i>shall be</i> in 
the house of the Lord for a very long time.</p>
<h2>Psalm 24</h2>
<h4>A Psalm for David on the first day 
of the week.</h4>
<p><small>24:1 </small> The earth is the Lord’s and 
the fullness thereof; the world, and all that dwell in it. <small>2 </small>
He has founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the rivers.</p>

<p><small>3 </small>Who shall go up to the mountain of the 
Lord, and who shall stand in his holy place? <small>4 </small>He that is innocent in his hands 
and pure in his heart; who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn 
deceitfully to his neighbour. <small>5 </small>
He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour.
<small>6 </small>This is the generation of them 
that seek him, that seek the face of the God of Jacob. Pause.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be 
ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the king of glory shall come in. <small>8 </small>
Who is this king of Glory? the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in 
battle. <small>9 </small>Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye 
lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the king of glory shall come in.
<small>10 </small>Who is this king of glory? The 
Lord of hosts, he is this king of glory.</p>
<h2>Psalm 25</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>25:1 </small>To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up 
my soul. <small>2 </small>
O my God, I have trusted in thee: let me not be confounded, 
neither let mine enemies laugh me to scorn. <small>3
</small>For none of them that wait on thee shall in any wise be 
ashamed: let them be ashamed that transgress without cause. <small>4 </small>Shew me thy ways, O Lord; and 
teach me thy paths. <small>5 </small>Lead me 
in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art God my Saviour: and I have waited on 
thee all the day. <small>6 </small>Remember thy 
compassions, O Lord, and thy mercies, for they are from everlasting. <small>7 </small>Remember not the sins of my youth, 
nor <i>my sins</i> of ignorance: remember me according to thy mercy, for thy 
goodness’ sake, O Lord.</p>

<p><small>8 </small>Good and upright is the Lord: 
therefore will he instruct sinners in <i>the</i> way. <small>9
</small>The meek will he guide in judgment: the meek will he teach 
his ways. <small>10 </small>All the ways of the 
Lord are mercy and truth to them that seek his covenant and his testimonies. <small>11 </small>
For thy name’s sake, O Lord, do thou also be merciful to my sin; for it is 
great. <small>12 </small>Who is the man that fears the Lord? he 
shall instruct him in the way which he has chosen. <small>13 </small>His soul shall dwell in prosperity; and 
his seed shall inherit the earth. <small>14
</small>The Lord is the strength of them that fear him; 
and his covenant is to manifest <i>truth</i> to them.</p>

<p><small>15 </small>Mine eyes are continually to the 
Lord; for he shall draw my feet out of the snare. <small>
16 </small>Look upon me, and have mercy upon me; for I am an only 
child and poor. <small>17 </small>The afflictions 
of my heart have been multiplied; deliver me from my distresses.
<small>18 </small>Look upon mine affliction and my 
trouble; and forgive all my sins. <small>19 </small>
Look upon mine enemies; for they have been multiplied; and they 
have hated me with unjust hatred. <small>20 </small>
Keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I have 
hoped in thee. <small>21 </small>The harmless and 
upright joined themselves to me: for I waited for thee, O Lord.
<small>22 </small>Deliver Israel, O God, out of all 
his afflictions.</p>
<h2>Psalm 26</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</h4>
<p><small>26:1 </small>Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked 
in my innocence: and hoping in the Lord I shall not be moved. <small>2 </small>
Prove me, O Lord, and try me; purify as with fire my reins and my heart. </p>
<p>
<small>3 </small>For thy mercy is before mine eyes: and I 
am well pleased with thy truth. <small>4 </small>
I have not sat with the council of vanity, and will in nowise 
enter in with transgressors. <small>5 </small>
I have hated the assembly of wicked doers; and will not 
sit with ungodly <i>men</i>.
<small>6 </small>I will wash my hands in innocency, and compass thine altar, O Lord: <small>7 </small>
to hear the voice of praise, and to declare all thy wonderful 
works. <small>8</small> O Lord, I have loved the 
beauty of thy house, and the place of the tabernacle of thy glory. <small>9 </small>
Destroy not my soul together with the ungodly, nor my life with bloody men: <small>10
</small>in whose hands <i>are</i> iniquities, <i>and</i> 
their right hand is filled with bribes. <small>11 </small>
But I have walked in my innocence: redeem me, and have mercy upon 
me. <small>12 </small>My foot stands in an even 
place: in the congregations will I bless thee, O Lord.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Psalm 27</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David, before he 
was anointed.</h4>
<p><small>27:1 </small>The Lord is my light and my Saviour; whom shall I 
fear? the Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? <small>2 </small>When evil-doers drew nigh against me to 
eat up my flesh, my persecutors and mine enemies, they fainted and fell.
<small>3 </small>Though an army should set itself 
in array against me, my heart shall not be afraid: though war should rise up 
against me, in this am I confident. <small>4 </small>One thing have I asked of the Lord, this will I earnestly seek: 
that I should dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life, that I 
should behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and survey his temple. <small>5 </small>For in the day of mine afflictions he hid 
me in his tabernacle: he sheltered me in the secret of his tabernacle; he set me 
up on a rock. <small>6 </small>And now, behold, he 
has lifted up mine head over mine enemies: I went round and offered in his 
tabernacle the sacrifice of joy; I will sing even sing psalms to the Lord.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>Hear, O Lord, my voice which I have 
uttered aloud: pity me, and hearken to me. <small>8 </small>
My heart said to thee, I have diligently sought thy face: thy 
face, O Lord, I will seek. <small>9 </small>
Turn not thy face away from me, turn not thou away from thy servant in 
anger: be thou my helper, forsake me not; and, O God my Saviour, overlook me 
not. <small>10 </small>For my father and my mother 
have forsaken me, but the Lord has taken me to himself. <small>11 </small>Teach me, O Lord, in thy way, and guide 
me in a right path, because of mine enemies. <small>12
</small>Deliver me not over to the desire of them that afflict me; 
for unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and injustice has lied within 
herself. </p>
<p><small>13 </small>I believe that I shall 
see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
<small>14 </small>Wait on the Lord: be of good 
courage, and let thy heart be strengthened: yea wait on the Lord.</p>

<h2>Psalm 28</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</h4>
<p><small>28:1 </small>To thee, O Lord, have I cried; my 
God, be not silent toward me: lest thou be silent toward me, and so I should be 
likened to them that go down to the pit. <small>2 </small>
Hearken to the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee, when I lift up my 
hands toward thy holy temple. <small>3 </small>Draw not away my 
soul with sinners, and destroy me not with the workers of iniquity, who speak 
peace with their neighbours, but evils are in their hearts. <small>4 </small>Give them according to their works, and 
according to the wickedness of their devices: give them according to the works 
of their hands; render their recompense unto them. <small>5 </small>Because they have not attended to 
the works of the Lord, even to the works of his hands, thou shalt pull them 
down, and shalt not build them up.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>Blessed be the Lord, for he has 
hearkened to the voice of my petition. <small>7 </small>
The Lord is my helper and my defender; my heart has hoped in him, 
and I am helped: my flesh has revived, and willingly will I give praise to him. <small>8 </small>
The Lord is the strength of his people, and the saving defender of his anointed. </p>
<p>
<small>9 </small>Save thy people, and bless thine 
inheritance: and take care of them, and lift them up for ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 29</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David <i>on 
the occasion</i> of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle.</h4>
<p><small>29:1 </small>Bring to the Lord, 
ye sons of God, bring to the Lord young rams; bring to the Lord glory and honour.
<small>2 </small>Bring to the Lord glory, <i>
due</i> to his name; worship the lord in his holy court. </p>
<p><small>3
</small>The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory 
has thundered: the Lord is upon many waters. <small>4
</small>The voice of the Lord is mighty; the voice of the Lord is 
full of majesty. <small>5 </small> <i>
There is</i> the voice of the Lord who breaks the cedars; the Lord will break 
the cedars of Libanus. <small>6 </small>And 
he will beat them small, <i>even</i> Libanus itself, like a calf; and the 
beloved one is as a young unicorn. <small>7 </small>
 <i>There is</i> a voice of the Lord who divides a flame of 
fire. <small>8 </small>A voice of the Lord who 
shakes the wilderness; the Lord will shake the wilderness of Cades. <small>9 </small>The voice of the Lord strengthens 
the hinds, and will uncover the thickets: and in his temple every one speaks <i>
of his</i> glory. <small>10 </small>The 
Lord will dwell on the waterflood: and the Lord will sit a king for ever. <small>11 </small>The Lord will give strength to his 
people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.</p>
<h2>Psalm 30</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm and Song at 
the dedication of the house of David.</h4>
<p><small>30:1 </small>I will exalt thee, O Lord; for thou 
hast lifted me up, and not caused mine enemies to rejoice over me. <small>2 </small>O Lord my God, I cried to thee, and thou 
didst heal me. <small>3 </small>O 
Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from Hades, thou hast delivered me from <i>
among</i> them that go down to the pit. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
Sing to the Lord, ye his saints, and give thanks for the 
remembrance of his holiness. <small>5 </small>
For anger is in his wrath, but life in his favour: weeping shall tarry 
for the evening, but joy shall be in the morning.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>And I said in my prosperity, I shall 
never be moved. <small>7 </small>O Lord, in thy 
good pleasure thou didst add strength to my beauty: but thou didst turn away thy 
face, and I was troubled. <small>8 </small>
To thee, O Lord, will I cry; and to my God will I make 
supplication. <small>9 </small>What profit is there 
in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Shall the dust give praise to thee? 
or shall it declare thy truth? <small>10 </small>
The Lord heard, and had compassion upon me; the Lord is become my 
helper. <small>11 </small>Thou hast turned my 
mourning into joy for me: thou hast rent off my sackcloth, and girded me with 
gladness; <small>12 </small>that my glory may sing praise to thee, and I may not be pierced <i>with sorrow</i>. 
O Lord my God, I will give thanks to thee for ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 31</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of 
David, <i>an utterance</i> of extreme fear.</h4>
<p><small>31:1 </small>O Lord, I have hoped in thee; let 
me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness and rescue me. <small>2 </small>Incline thine ear to me; make 
haste to rescue me: be thou to me for a protecting God, and for a house of 
refuge to save me. <small>3 </small>For thou 
art my strength and my refuge; and thou shalt guide me for thy name’s sake, and 
maintain me. <small>4 </small>Thou shalt 
bring me out of the snare which they have hidden for me; for thou, O Lord, art 
my defender. <small>5 </small>Into thine 
hands I will commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.
<small>6 </small>Thou has hated them that idly 
persist in vanities: but I have hoped in the Lord. <small>7
</small>I will exult and be glad in thy mercy: for thou hast 
looked upon mine affliction; thou hast saved my soul from distresses.
<small>8 </small>And thou hast not shut me up into 
the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a wide place.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>Pity me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: 
my eye is troubled with indignation, my soul and by belly. <small>10 </small>For my life is spent with grief, 
and my years with groanings: my strength has been weakened through poverty, and 
my bones are troubled. <small>11 </small>I 
became a reproach among all mine enemies, but exceedingly so to my neighbours, 
and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that saw me without fled from me. <small>12 </small>I have been forgotten as a dead man out 
of mind: I am become as a broken vessel. <small>13 </small>
For I heard the slander of many that dwelt round about: when they 
were gathered together against me, they took counsel to take my life.
</p>
<p><small>14 </small>But I hoped in thee, O Lord: I 
said, Thou art my God. <small>15 </small>
My lots are in thy hands: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,
<small>16 </small>and from them that persecute me. 
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me in thy mercy.
<small>17 </small>O Lord, let me not be ashamed, 
for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be ashamed, and brought down to 
Hades. <small>18 </small>Let the deceitful lips 
become dumb, which speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn.</p>

<p><small>19 </small>How abundant is the 
multitude of thy goodness, O Lord, which thou hast laid up for them that fear 
thee! thou hast wrought <i>it</i> out for them that hope on thee, in the 
presence of the sons of men. <small>20 </small>
Thou wilt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the vexation of man: thou 
wilt screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.
<small>21 </small>Blessed be the Lord: for he has 
magnified his mercy in a fortified city. <small>22 </small>
But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the 
sight of thine eyes: therefore thou didst hearken, O Lord, to the voice of my 
supplication when I cried to thee. </p>
<p><small>23 </small>
Love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord seeks for 
truth, and renders <i>a reward</i> to them that deal very proudly. <small>24 </small>Be of good courage, and let your heart 
be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.</p>
<h2>Psalm 32</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of instruction by 
David.</h4>
<p><small>32:1 </small>Blessed <i>are they</i> whose transgressions are 
forgiven, and who sins are covered. <small>2 </small>
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and 
whose mouth there is no guile. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>
Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old, from my crying all 
the day. <small>4 </small>For day and 
night thy hand was heavy upon me: I became thoroughly miserable while a thorn 
was fastened in <i>me</i>. Pause. <small>5 </small>
I acknowledged my sin, and hid not mine iniquity: I said, I will confess 
mine iniquity to the Lord against myself; and thou forgavest the ungodliness of 
my heart. Pause. <small>6 </small>Therefore shall 
every holy one pray to thee in a fit time: only in the deluge of many waters 
they shall not come nigh to him.
<small>7 </small>Thou art my refuge from the affliction 
that encompasses me; my joy, to deliver me from them that have compassed me. 
Pause. </p>
<p><small>8 </small>I will 
instruct thee and guide thee in this way wherein thou shalt go: I will fix mine 
eyes upon thee. <small>9 </small>Be ye not 
as horse and mule, which have no understanding; <i>but thou must</i> constrain 
their jaws with bit and curb, lest they should come nigh to thee. <small>10 </small>Many are the scourges of the sinner: but 
him that hopes in the Lord mercy shall compass about. <small>11 </small>Be glad in the Lord, and exult, ye 
righteous: and glory, all ye that are upright in heart.</p>

<h2>Psalm 33</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</h4>
<p><small>33:1 </small>Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; 
praise becomes the upright. <small>2 </small>Praise the Lord on the harp; platy to him 
on a psaltery of ten strings. <small>3 </small>
Sing to him a new song; play skillfully with a loud noise.
</p>
<p><small>4 </small>For the word of the Lord is right; 
and all his works are faithful. <small>5 </small>
He loves mercy and judgment; the earth is full the mercy of the 
Lord. <small>6 </small>By the word of 
the Lord the heavens were established; and all the host of them by the breath of 
his <i>mouth</i>. <small>7 </small>Who 
gathers the waters of the sea as <i>in</i> a bottle; who lays up the deeps in 
treasuries. <small>8 </small>Let all the earth fear 
the Lord; and let all that dwell in the world be moved because of him. <small>9 </small>
For he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created. <small>10 </small>
The Lord frustrates the counsels of the nations; he 
brings to nought also the reasonings of the peoples, and brings to nought the 
counsels of princes. <small>11 </small>But the 
counsel of the Lord endures for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation 
to generation.
<small>12 </small>Blessed is the nation whose God is 
the Lord; the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance. <small>13 </small>The Lord looks out of heaven; he beholds 
all the sons of men. <small>14 </small>
He looks from his prepared habitation on all the dwellers on the earth;
<small>15 </small>who fashioned their hearts alone; 
who understands all their works. <small>16 </small>
A king is not saved by reason of a great host; and a giant shall 
not be delivered by the greatness of his strength. <small>17 </small>A horse is vain for safety; neither 
shall he be delivered by the greatness of his power. </p>
<p>
<small>18 </small>Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on them 
that fear him, those that hope in his mercy; <small>19
</small>to deliver their souls from death, and to keep them alive 
in famine. <small>20 </small>Our soul waits on the 
Lord; for he is our helper and defender. <small>21 </small>For our heart shall rejoice in him, and 
we have hoped in his holy name. <small>22 </small>
Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in 
thee.</p>
<h2>Psalm 34</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David, 
when he changed his countenance before Abimelech; and he let him go, and he 
departed.</h4>
<p><small>34:1 </small>I will bless the Lord at all times: 
his praise shall be continually in my mouth. <small>2 </small>
My soul shall boast herself in the Lord: let the meek hear, and rejoice. <small>3 </small>Magnify ye the Lord with me, and let us 
exalt his name together. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
I sought the Lord diligently, and he hearkened to me, and delivered me 
from all my sojournings. <small>5 </small>Draw near to him, and be enlightened: and your faces shall not <i>by any means</i> 
be ashamed. <small>6 </small>This poor man cried, 
and the Lord hearkened to him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions. <small>7 </small>
The angel of the Lord will encamp round about them that fear him, and will 
deliver them.
<small>8 </small>Taste and see that the Lord is 
good: blessed is the man who hopes in him. <small>9 </small>
Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: for there is no want to them 
that fear him. <small>10 </small>The rich have 
become poor and hungry: but they that seek the Lord diligently shall not want 
any good thing. Pause.</p>

<p><small>11 </small>Come, ye children, hear me: I will 
teach you the fear of the Lord. <small>12 </small>
What man is there that desires life, loving to see good days? <small>13 </small>
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. <small>14 </small>
Turn away from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. </p>
<p><small>15 </small>The eyes of the Lord 
are over the righteous, and his ears <i>are open</i> to their prayer: <small>16 </small>but the face of the Lord is against them 
that do evil, to destroy their memorial from the earth. The righteous cried, and 
the Lord hearkened to them, <small>17 </small>
and delivered them out of all their afflictions. <small>18 </small>The Lord is near to them that are of a 
contrite heart; and will save the lowly in spirit. <small>19 </small>Many are the afflictions of the 
righteous: but out of them all Lord will deliver them. <small>20
</small>He keeps all their bones: not one of them shall be broken. <small>21 </small>
The death of sinners is evil: and they that hate righteousness will go wrong. <small>22 </small>The Lord will redeem the souls of his 
servants: and none of those that hope in him shall go wrong.</p>
<h2>Psalm 35</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</h4>
<p><small>35:1 </small>Judge thou, O Lord, them that 
injure me, fight against them that fight against me. <small>2 </small>
Take hold of shield and buckler, and arise for my help. <small>3 </small>
Bring forth a sword, and stop <i>the way</i> against them 
that persecute me: say to my soul, I am thy salvation. <small>4
</small>Let them that seek my soul be ashamed and confounded: let 
them that devise evils against me be turned back and put to shame. <small>5 </small>
Let them be as dust before the wind, and an angel of the Lord afflicting them. <small>6 </small>Let their way be dark and slippery, and 
an angel of the Lord persecuting them. <small>7
</small>For without cause they have hid for me their destructive 
snare: without a cause they have reproached my soul. </p>
<p>
<small>8 </small>Let a snare which they know not come upon 
them; and the gin which they hid take them; and let them fall into the very same 
snare. <small>9 </small>But my soul shall exult in 
the Lord: it shall delight in his salvation. <small>10 </small>All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is 
like to thee? delivering the poor out of the hand of them that are stronger than 
he, yea, the poor and needy one from them that spoil him.</p>

<p><small>11 </small>Unjust witnesses arose, and asked me 
of things I new not. <small>12 </small>
They rewarded me evil for good, and bereavement to my soul. <small>13 </small>But I, when they troubled me, 
put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting: and my prayer shall return 
to my <i>own</i> bosom. <small>14 </small>I 
behaved agreeably towards them as <i>if it had been</i> our neighbour <i>or</i> 
brother: I humbled myself as one mourning and sad of countenance. <small>15 </small>Yet they rejoiced against me, 
and plagues were plentifully brought against me, and I knew <i>it</i> not: they 
were scattered, but repented not. <small>16 </small>
They tempted me, they sneered at me most contemptuously, they 
gnashed their teeth upon me.</p>

<p><small>17 </small>O Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? 
Deliver my soul from their mischief, mine only-begotten one from the lions. <small>18 </small>
I will give thanks to thee even in a great congregation: in an abundant people I 
will praise thee.
<small>19 </small>Let not them that are mine 
enemies without a cause rejoice against me; who hate me for nothing, and wink 
with their eyes. <small>20 </small>For 
to me they spoke peaceably, but imagined deceits in <i>their</i> anger. <small>21 </small>And they opened wide their mouth 
upon me; they said Aha, aha, our eyes have seen <i>it</i>. </p>
<p>
<small>22 </small>Thou hast seen <i>it</i>, O 
Lord: keep not silence: O Lord, withdraw not <i>thyself</i> from me. <small>23 </small>Awake, O Lord, and attend to my 
judgment, <i>even</i> to my cause, my God and my Lord. <small>24
</small>Judge me, O Lord, according to thy righteousness, O Lord 
my God; and let them not rejoice against me. <small>25
</small>Let them not say in their hearts, Aha, aha, <i>it 
is pleasing</i> to our soul: neither let them say, We have devoured him. <small>26 </small>Let them be confounded and ashamed 
together that rejoice at my afflictions: let them be clothed with shame and 
confusion that speak great swelling words against me. <small>
27 </small>Let them that rejoice in my righteousness exult and be 
glad: and let them say continually, The Lord be magnified, who desire the peace 
of his servant. <small>28 </small>And 
my tongue shall meditate on thy righteousness, <i>and</i> on thy praise all the 
day.</p>
<h2>Psalm 36</h2>
<h4>For the end, by David the servant 
of the Lord.</h4>
<p><small>36:1 </small>The transgressor, that he may sin, says within 
himself, <i>that</i> there is no fear of God before his eyes. <small>2 </small>For he has dealt craftily before him, to 
discover his iniquity and hate it. <small>3 </small>
The words of his mouth are transgression and deceit: he is 
not inclined to understand <i>how</i> to do good. <small>4 </small>
He devises iniquity on his bed; he gives himself to every evil 
way; and does not abhor evil.</p>

<p><small>5 </small>O Lord, thy mercy is in the 
heaven; and thy truth <i>reaches</i> to the clouds. <small>6
</small>Thy righteousness is as the mountains of God, thy 
judgments are as a great deep: O Lord, thou wilt preserve men and beasts. <small>7 </small>How hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O 
God! so the children of men shall trust in the shelter of thy wings.
<small>8 </small>They shall be fully 
satisfied with the fatness of thine house; and thou shalt cause them to drink of 
the full stream of thy delights. <small>9 </small>
For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light we shall see light.
</p>
<p><small>10 </small>Extend thy mercy to them that 
know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. <small>11 </small>Let not the foot of pride come against 
me, and let not the hand of sinners move me. </p>
<p><small>12
</small>There have all the workers of iniquity fallen: they are 
cast out, and shall not be able to stand.</p>
<h2>Psalm 37</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</h4>
<p><small>37:1 </small>Fret not thyself because of 
evil-doers, neither be envious of them that do iniquity. <small>2 </small>
For they shall soon be withered as the grass, and shall soon fall away as the 
green herbs.
<small>3 </small>Hope in the Lord, and do 
good; and dwell on the land, and thou shalt be fed with the wealth of it. <small>4 </small>Delight <i>thyself</i> in the 
Lord; and he shall grant thee the requests of thine heart. <small>5 </small>Disclose thy way to the Lord, and 
hope in him; and he shall bring <i>it</i> to pass. <small>6
</small>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, 
and thy judgment as the noon-day.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>Submit thyself to the Lord, and 
supplicate him: fret not thyself because of him that prospers in his way, at the 
man that does unlawful deeds. <small>8 </small>
ease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself so as to do evil.
<small>9 </small>For evil-doers shall be destroyed: 
but they that wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land. <small>10 </small>And yet a little while, and the 
sinner shall not be, and thou shalt seek for his place, and shalt not find <i>it</i>.
<small>11 </small>But the meek shall 
inherit the earth; and shall delight <i>themselves</i> in the abundance of 
peace. </p>
<p><small>12 </small>The sinner will watch for 
the righteous, and gnash his teeth upon him. <small>13
</small>But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his 
day will come. <small>14 </small>Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent their bow, to cast down the poor 
and needy one, <i>and</i> to slay the upright in heart. <small>15
</small>Let their sword enter into their <i>own</i> heart, 
and their bows be broken. </p>
<p><small>16 </small>A 
little is better to the righteous than abundant wealth of sinners. <small>17 </small>For the arms of sinners shall be broken; 
but the Lord supports the righteous. </p>
<p><small>18 </small>
The Lord knows the ways of the perfect; and their inheritance 
shall be for ever. <small>19 </small>
They shall not be ashamed in an evil time; and in days of famine they shall be 
satisfied. <small>20 </small>For 
the sinners shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their 
being honoured and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke.
<small>21 </small>The sinner borrows, and will not pay 
again: but the righteous has compassion, and gives. <small>22 </small>For they that bless him shall inherit 
the earth; and they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed. </p>
<p>
<small>23 </small>The steps of a man are rightly ordered 
by the Lord: and he will take pleasure in his way. <small>24 </small>When he falls, he shall not be ruined: 
for the Lord supports his hand. <small>25 </small>
I was <i>once</i> young, indeed I am now old; yet I have 
not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread. <small>26 </small>He is merciful, and lends continually; 
and his seed shall be blessed. </p>
<p><small>27 </small>
Turn aside from evil, and do good; and dwell for ever.
<small>28 </small>For the Lord loves judgment, and 
will not forsake his saints; they shall be preserved for ever: the blameless 
shall be avenged, but the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. <small>29 </small>
But the righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever. </p>
<p>
<small>30 </small>The mouth of the righteous will meditate 
wisdom, and his tongue will speak of judgment. <small>31
</small>The law of his God is in his heart; and his steps shall 
not slide. <small>32 </small>The sinner watches the 
righteous, and seeks to slay him. <small>33
</small>But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor by any 
means condemn him when he is judged.<small> 34 </small>Wait on the Lord, and keep 
his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are 
destroyed, thou shalt see <i>it</i>. </p>
<p><small>35 </small>
I saw the ungodly very highly exalting himself, and 
lifting himself up like the cedars of Libanus. <small>36 </small>
Yet I passed by, and lo! he was not: and I sought him, but his 
place was not found. <small>37 </small>
Maintain innocence, and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the 
peaceable man. <small>38 </small>But the 
transgressors shall be utterly destroyed together: the remnants of the ungodly 
shall be utterly destroyed. <small>39 </small>
But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; and he is 
their defender in the time of affliction. <small>40 </small>
And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: and he shall 
rescue them from sinners, and save them, because they have hoped in him.</p>

<h2>Psalm 38</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David for remembrance 
concerning the Sabbath-day.</h4>
<p><small>38:1 </small>O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, 
neither chasten me in thine anger. <small>2 </small>
For thy weapons are fixed in me, and thou hast pressed thy hand 
heavily upon me. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>For 
there is no health in my flesh because of thine anger; there is no peace to my 
bones because of my sins. <small>4 </small>For my 
transgressions have gone over mine head: they have pressed heavily upon me like 
a weighty burden. <small>5 </small>My bruises have 
become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness. <small>6 </small>I have been wretched and bowed down 
continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day. <small>7 </small>For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh. <small>8 </small>
I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared 
for the groaning of my heart. </p>
<p><small>9 </small>
But all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hidden 
from thee. <small>10 </small>My heart is troubled, 
my strength has failed me; and the light of mine eyes is not with me. <small>11 </small>My friends and 
my neighbours drew near before me, and stood still; and my nearest of kin stood 
afar off.
<small>12 </small>While they pressed hard upon me that 
sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits 
all the day. <small>13 </small>
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth. <small>14 </small>
And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth. </p>
<p><small>15
</small>For I hoped in thee, O Lord: thou wilt hear, O Lord my 
God. <small>16 </small>For I said, Lest mine 
enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly 
against me. <small>17 </small>For I am ready for 
plagues, and my grief is continually before me. <small>18 </small>For I will declare mine iniquity, and be 
distressed for my sin. <small>19 </small>
But mine enemies live, and are mightier than I: and they that 
hate me unjustly are multiplied. <small>20 </small>
They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed 
righteousness. <small>21 </small>Forsake me not, O 
Lord my God: depart not from me. <small>22
</small>Draw nigh to my help, O Lord of my salvation.</p>
<h2>Psalm 39</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Song of 
David, to Idithun.</h4>
<p><small>39:1 </small>I said, I will take heed to my 
ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I set a guard on my mouth, while the sinner 
stood in my presence. <small>2 </small>I was dumb, and humbled myself, 
and kept silence from good <i>words</i>; and my grief was renewed. <small>3 </small>My heart grew hot within me, and a fire 
would kindle in my meditation: I spoke with my tongue, </p>
<p>
<small>4 </small>O Lord, make me to know mine end, and the 
number of my days, what it is; that I may know what I lack. <small>5 </small>Behold, thou hast made my days 
old; and my existence <i>is</i> as nothing before thee: nay, every man living <i>
is</i> altogether vanity. Pause. <small>6 </small>
Surely man walks in a shadow; nay, he is disquieted in vain: he lays up 
treasures, and knows not for whom he shall gather them.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>And now what <i>is</i> my 
expectation? <i>is it</i> not the Lord? and my ground <i>of hope</i> is with 
thee. Pause. <small>8 </small>Deliver me from all 
my transgressions: thou hast made me a reproach to the foolish. <small>9 </small>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth; for 
thou art he that made me. <small>10 </small>
Remove thy scourges from me: I have fainted by reason of 
the strength of thine hand. <small>11 </small>
Thou chastenest man with rebukes for iniquity, and thou makest his life 
to consume away like a spider’s web; nay, every man is disquieted in vain. 
Pause. </p>
<p><small>12 </small>O Lord, hearken to 
my prayer and my supplication: attend to my tears: be not silent, for I am a 
sojourner in the land, and a stranger, as all my fathers <i>were</i>. <small>13 </small>Spare me, that I may be refreshed, 
before I depart, and be no more.</p>
<h2>Psalm 40</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>40:1 </small> I waited patiently for the 
Lord; and he attended to me, and hearkened to my supplication. <small>2 </small>
And he brought me up out of a pit of misery, and from miry clay: and he set my 
feet on a rock, and ordered my goings aright. <small>3 </small>
And he put a new song into my mouth, <i>even</i> a hymn to 
our God: many shall see <i>it</i>, and fear, and shall hope in the Lord. <small>4 </small>Blessed <i>is</i> the man whose 
hope is in the name of the Lord, and <i>who</i> has not regarded vanities and 
false frenzies. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>O Lord my 
God, thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, and in thy thoughts there is none 
who shall be likened to thee: I declared and spoke <i>of them</i>: they exceeded 
number.
<small>6 </small>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not; but a body hast thou prepared me: whole-burnt-offering and <i>
sacrifice</i> for sin thou didst not require. <small>7 </small>
Then I said, Behold, I come: in the volume of the book it is 
written concerning me, <small>8 </small>I desired 
to do thy will, O my God, and thy law in the midst of mine heart. <small>9 </small>I have preached righteousness in 
the great congregation; lo! I will not refrain my lips; O Lord, thou knowest my 
righteousness. <small>10 </small>I have not hid thy 
truth within my heart, and I have declared thy salvation; I have not hid thy 
mercy and thy truth from the great congregation.</p>

<p><small>11 </small>But thou, Lord, remove not thy 
compassion far from me; thy mercy and thy truth have helped me continually.
<small>12 </small>For innumerable evils have 
encompassed me; my transgressions have taken hold of me, and I could not see; 
they are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; and my heart has failed me. <small>13 </small>
Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, draw nigh to help me. <small>14 </small>
Let those that seek my soul, to destroy it, be ashamed and 
confounded together; let those that wish me evil be turned backward and put to 
shame. <small>15 </small>Let those that say to me, 
Aha, aha, quickly receive shame for their reward. <small>16 </small>Let all those that seek thee, O Lord, 
exult and rejoice in thee; and let them that love thy salvation say continually, 
The Lord be magnified. <small>17 </small>
But I am poor and needy; the Lord will take care of me; thou art 
my helper, and my defender, O my God, delay not.</p>

<h2>Psalm 41</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>41:1 </small>Blessed <i>is the man</i> who thinks, on the poor and needy: the Lord 
shall deliver him in an evil day. <small>2 </small>
May the Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and bless him on the earth, and 
not deliver him into the hands of his enemy. <small>3 </small>
May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; thou hast made 
all his bed in his sickness. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against 
thee.
<small>5 </small>Mine enemies have spoken evil 
against me, <i>saying</i>, When shall he die, and his name perish? <small>6 </small>And if he came to see <i>me</i>, 
his heart spoke vainly; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth and spoke 
in like manner. <small>7 </small>All my enemies 
whispered against me; against me they devised my hurt. <small>8 </small>They denounced a wicked word 
against me, <i>saying</i>, Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again? <small>9 </small>For even the man of my peace, in 
whom I trusted, who ate my bread, lifted up <i>his</i> heel against me. </p>
<p>
<small>10 </small>But thou, O Lord, have compassion upon 
me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them. <small>11 </small>By this I know that thou hast delighted 
in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me. <small>12 </small>But thou didst help me because 
of <i>mine</i> innocence, and hast established me before thee for ever. <small>13 </small>Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord God 
of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. So be it, so be it.</p>
<h2>Psalm 42</h2>
<h4>For the end, <i>a Psalm</i> for 
instruction, for the sons of Core.</h4>
<p><small>42:1 </small>As the hart earnestly desires the 
fountains of water, so my soul earnestly longs for thee, O God. <small>2 </small>My soul has thirsted for the living God: 
when shall I come and appear before God? <small>3
</small>My tears have been bread to me day and night, while they 
daily said to me, Where is thy God? <small>4 </small>
I remembered these things, and poured out my soul in me, 
for I will go to the place of thy wondrous tabernacle, <i>even</i> to the house 
of God, with a voice of exultation and thanksgiving and of the sound of those 
who keep festival. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? hope 
in God; for I will give thanks to him; <i>he is</i> the salvation of my 
countenance.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>O my God, my soul has been 
troubled within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and 
of the Ermonites, from the little hill. <small>7 </small>
Deep calls to deep at the voice of thy cataracts: all thy billows 
and thy waves have gone over me. <small>8 </small>
By day the Lord will command his mercy, and manifest <i>it</i> 
by night: with me <i>is</i> prayer to the God of my life. <small>
9 </small>I will say to God, Thou art my helper; why hast 
thou forgotten me? wherefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy 
oppresses <i>me</i>? <small>10 </small>While my 
bones were breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; while they said to me 
daily, Where is thy God? </p>
<p><small>11 </small>
Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore 
dost thou trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; <i>he is</i> 
the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>
<h2>Psalm 43</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>43:1 </small>Judge me, o God, and plead my 
cause, against an ungodly nation: deliver me from the unjust and crafty man. <small>2 </small>For thou, O God, art my strength: wherefore hast thou cast me off? and why do I 
go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses <i>me</i>? <small>3 </small>Send forth thy light and thy truth: they 
have led me, and brought me to thy holy mountain, and to thy tabernacles. <small>4 </small>
And I will go in to the altar of God, to God who gladdens my youth: I will give 
thanks to thee on the harp, O God, my God. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? Hope 
in God; for I will give thanks to him, <i>who is</i> the health of my 
countenance, <i>and</i> my God.</p>
<h2>Psalm 44</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm for 
instruction, for the sons of Core.</h4>
<p><small>44:1 </small>O God, we have heard with our ears, our 
fathers have told us, the work which thou wroughtest in their days, in the days 
of old. <small>2 </small>Thine hand utterly 
destroyed the heathen, and thou didst plant them: thou didst afflict the 
nations, and cast them out. <small>3 </small>For they inherited not the land by their <i>own</i> sword, and their <i>own</i> 
arm did not deliver them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of 
thy countenance, because thou wert well pleased in them. </p>
<p><small>4
</small>Thou art indeed my King and my God, who commandest 
deliverances for Jacob. <small>5 </small>In 
thee will we push down our enemies, and in thy name will we bring to nought them 
that rise up against us. <small>6 </small>For I 
will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me. <small>7 </small>For thou hast saved us from them that 
afflicted us, and hast put to shame them that hated us. <small>8 </small>In God will we make our boast all the 
day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever. Pause.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>But now thou hast cast off, and put us 
to shame; and thou wilt not go forth with our hosts. <small>10 </small>Thou hast turned us back before our 
enemies; and they that hated us spoiled for themselves. <small>11 </small>Thou madest us as sheep for 
meat; and thou scatteredst us among the nations. <small>12 </small>
Thou hast sold thy people without price, and there was no profit 
by their exchange. <small>13 </small>Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision them that 
are round about us. <small>14 </small>Thou hast 
made us a proverb among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the nations. <small>15 </small>
All the day my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me, <small>16 </small>because of the voice of the slanderer 
and reviler; because of the enemy and avenger.</p>

<p><small>17 </small>All these things are come 
upon us: but we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt unrighteously in 
thy covenant. <small>18 </small>And our heart has 
not gone back; but thou hast turned aside our paths from thy way.
<small>19 </small>For thou hast laid us low in a 
place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us. <small>20 </small>If we have forgotten the name of our 
God, and if we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search 
these things out? <small>21 </small>for he knows 
the secrets of the heart. <small>22 </small>
For, for thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are counted 
as sheep for slaughter. </p>
<p><small>23 </small>
Awake, wherefore sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and do not cast <i>us</i> 
off for ever. <small>24 </small>Wherefore turnest thou thy face away, <i>and</i> forgettest our poverty and our 
affliction? <small>25 </small>For our soul has been 
brought down to the dust; our belly has cleaved to the earth. <small>26 </small>Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us 
for thy name’s sake.</p>
<h2>Psalm 45</h2>
<h4>For the end, for 
alternate <i>strains</i> by the sons of Core; for instruction, a Song concerning 
the beloved.</h4>
<p><small>45:1 </small>My heart has uttered a good matter: 
I declare my works to the king: my tongue is the pen of a quick writer. <small>2 </small>
Thou art more beautiful than the sons of men: grace has been shed 
forth on thy lips: therefore God has blessed thee for ever. <small>3 </small>Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O Mighty 
One, in thy comeliness, and in thy beauty; <small>4 </small>
and bend <i>thy bow</i>, and prosper, and reign, because 
of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall guide thee 
wonderfully. <small>5 </small>Thy weapons 
are sharpened, Mighty One, (the nations shall fall under thee) <i>they are</i> 
in the heart of the king’s enemies.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>Thy throne, O God, is for 
ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness. <small>7 </small>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated 
iniquity: therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness 
beyond thy fellows. </p>
<p><small>8 </small>
Myrrh, and stacte, and cassia <i>are exhaled</i> from thy garments, <i>
and</i> out of the ivory palaces, <small>9 </small>
with which kings’ daughters have gladdened thee for thine honour: the 
queen stood by on thy right hand, clothed in vesture wrought with gold, <i>and</i> 
arrayed in divers colours.
<small>10 </small>Hear, O daughter, and see, 
and incline thine ear; forget also thy people, and thy father’s house. <small>11 </small>Because the king has desired thy beauty; 
for he is thy Lord. <small>12 </small>
And the daughter of Tyre shall adore him with gifts; the rich of the 
people of the land shall supplicate thy favour. </p>
<p><small>13 </small>
All her glory <i>is that</i> of the daughter of the king 
of Esebon, robed <i>as she is</i> in golden fringed garments, <small>14 </small>in embroidered <i>clothing</i>: 
virgins shall be brought to the king after her: her fellows shall be brought to 
thee. <small>15 </small>They shall be brought with 
gladness and exultation: they shall be led into the king’s temple.
<small>16 </small>Instead of thy fathers 
children are born to thee: thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.
<small>17 </small>They shall make mention of thy 
name from generation to generation: therefore shall the nations give thanks to 
thee for ever, even for ever and ever.</p>
<h2>Psalm 46</h2>
<h4>For the end, for the sons of Core; 
a Psalm concerning secret things.</h4>
<p><small>46:1 </small>God is our refuge and strength, a 
help in the afflictions that have come heavily upon us. <small>2 </small>Therefore will we not fear when the earth 
is troubled, and the mountains are removed into the depths of the seas. <small>3 </small>
Their waters have roared and been troubled, the mountains have been troubled by 
his might. Pause.
<small>4 </small>The flowings of the river 
gladden the city of God: the Most High has sanctified his tabernacle. <small>5 </small>God is in the midst of her; she shall not 
be moved: God shall help her with his countenance.
<small>6 </small>The nations were troubled, the 
kingdoms tottered: he uttered his voice, the earth shook. <small>7 </small>The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of 
Jacob is our helper. Pause. </p>
<p><small>8 </small>
Come, and behold the works of the Lord, what wonders he has 
achieved on the earth. <small>9 </small>Putting an 
end to wars as for the ends of the earth; he will crush the bow, and break in 
pieces the weapon, and burn the bucklers with fire. <small>10 </small>Be still, and know that I am God: I will 
be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. <small>11 </small>The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of 
Jacob is our helper.</p>

<h2>Psalm 47</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm for the sons 
of Core. </h4>
<p><small>47:1 </small>Clap your hands, all ye nations; 
shout to God with a voice of exultation. <small>2 </small>For the Lord 
most high is terrible; <i>he is</i> a great king over all the earth. <small>3 </small>He has subdued the peoples under us, and 
the nations under our feet. <small>4 </small>
He has chosen out his inheritance for us, the beauty of Jacob 
which he loved. Pause.</p>

<p><small>5 </small>God is gone up with a shout, the Lord 
with a sound of a trumpet. <small>6 </small>
Sing praises to our God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, 
sing praises. <small>7 </small>For God is king of 
all the earth: sing praises with understanding. <small>8 </small>God reigns over the nations: God sits 
upon the throne of his holiness. <small>9 </small>
The rulers of the people are assembled with the God of Abraam: for God’s mighty ones of the earth have been greatly exalted.</p>
<h2>Psalm 48</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of praise for 
the sons of Core on the second <i>day</i> of the week.</h4>
<p><small>48:1 </small>Great is the Lord, and greatly to 
be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. <small>2 </small>The city of the great King is well 
planted <i>on</i> the mountains of Sion, with the joy of the whole earth, <i>on</i> 
the sides of the north. <small>3 </small>God is 
known in her palaces, when he undertakes to help her. </p>
<p><small>4
</small>For, behold the kings of the earth were assembled, they 
came together. <small>5 </small>They saw, and so 
they wondered: they were troubled, they were moved. <small>6 </small>Trembling took hold on them: there were 
the pangs as of a woman in travail. <small>7 </small>
Thou wilt break the ships of Tharsis with a vehement wind.<small> 8 </small>As we have heard, so have we also 
seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God has founded 
it for ever. Pause. </p>
<p><small>9 </small>We have 
thought of thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy people. <small>10 </small>According to thy name, O God, so is also 
thy praise to the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. <small>11 </small>Let mount Sion rejoice, let the daughters of Judaea exult, because of thy judgments, O 
Lord. </p>
<p><small>12 </small>Go round about Sion, 
and encompass her: tell ye her towers. <small>13 </small>
Mark ye well her strength, and observe her palaces; that ye may 
tell the next generation. <small>14 </small>
For this is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide for evermore.</p>
<h2>Psalm 49</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm for the sons 
of Core.</h4>
<p><small>49:1 </small>Hear these words, all ye nations, 
hearken, all ye that dwell upon the earth: <small>2 </small>both the 
sons of mean men, and sons of <i>great</i> men; the rich and poor <i>man</i> 
together. <small>3 </small>My mouth shall 
speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall bring <i>forth</i> 
understanding. <small>4 </small>I will incline mine 
ear to a parable: I will open my riddle on the harp. </p>
<p>
<small>5 </small>Wherefore should I fear in the evil day? 
the iniquity of my heel shall compass me.
<small>6 </small>They that trust in their strength, and 
boast themselves in the multitude of their wealth— <small>7 </small>A brother does not redeem, shall a man 
redeem? he shall not give to God a ransom for himself, <small>8 </small>or the price of the redemption of 
his soul, though he labour for ever, <small>9 </small>
and live to the end, <i>so</i> that he should not see 
corruption. </p>
<p><small>10 </small>When he shall see 
wise men dying, the fool and the senseless one shall perish together; and they 
shall leave their wealth to strangers. <small>11 </small>
And their sepulchres are their houses for ever, <i>even</i> 
their tabernacles to all generations: they have called their lands after their 
own names. <small>12 </small>And man being 
in honour, understands not: he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like 
to them. <small>13 </small>This their way is an 
offence to them: yet afterwards men will commend their sayings. Pause.
<small>14 </small>They have laid <i>them</i> 
as sheep in Hades; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion 
over them in the morning, and their help shall fail in Hades from their glory.<small> 15 </small>But God shall deliver my soul from 
the power of Hades, when he shall receive me. Pause. </p>
<p>
<small>16 </small>Fear not when a man is enriched, and 
when the glory of his house is increased. <small>17 </small>
For he shall take nothing when he dies; neither shall his glory 
descend with him. <small>18 </small>For his soul 
shall be blessed in his life: he shall give thanks to thee when thou dost well 
to him. <small>19 </small> <i>
Yet</i> he shall go in to the generation of his fathers; he shall never see 
light. <small>20 </small>Man that is in honour, understands not: he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like 
them.</p>
<h2>Psalm 50</h2>
<h4>A Psalm for Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>50:1 </small>The 
God of gods, the Lord, has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the 
sun to the going down <i>thereof</i>. <small>2 </small>
Out of Sion <i>comes</i> the excellence of his beauty.
<small>3 </small>God, our God, shall come 
manifestly, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before him, and 
round about him there shall be a very great tempest. <small>4
</small>He shall summon the heaven above, and the earth, that he 
may judge his people. <small>5 </small>
Assemble ye his saints to him, those that have engaged in a covenant with him 
upon sacrifices. <small>6 </small>And the heavens 
shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge. Pause.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>Hear, my people, and I will speak to 
thee, O Israel: and I will testify to thee: I am God, thy God. <small>8 </small>I will not reprove thee on account of thy 
sacrifices; for thy whole-burnt-offerings are before me continually.
<small>9 </small>I will take no bullocks out 
of thine house, nor he-goats out of thy flocks. <small>10 </small>
For all the wild beasts of the thicket are mine, the cattle on 
the mountains, and oxen. <small>11 </small>
I know all the birds of the sky; and the beauty of the field is 
mine. <small>12 </small>If I should be hungry, I 
will not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fullness of it. <small>13 </small>
Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? <small>14 </small>
Offer to God the sacrifice of praise; and pay thy vows to the 
Most High. <small>15 </small>And call 
upon me in the day of affliction; and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt 
glorify me. Pause.</p>

<p><small>16 </small>But to the sinner God has said, Why 
dost thou declare my ordinances, and take up my covenant in thy mouth?
<small>17 </small>Whereas thou hast hated 
instruction, and hast cast my words behind <i>thee</i>. <small>18
</small>If thou sawest a thief, thou rannest along with 
him, and hast cast in thy lot with adulterers. <small>19 </small>
Thy mouth has multiplied wickedness, and thy tongue has framed 
deceit. <small>20 </small>Thou didst sit and speak 
against thy brother, and didst scandalize thy mother’s son. </p>
<p>
<small>21 </small>These things thou didst, and I 
kept silence: thou thoughtest wickedly that I should be like thee, <i>but</i> I 
will reprove thee, and set <i>thine offences</i> before thee. <small>22 </small>Now consider these things, ye 
that forget God, lest he rend <i>you</i>, and there is no deliverer. </p>
<p>
<small>23 </small>The sacrifice of praise will 
glorify me: and that is the way wherein I will shew to him the salvation of God.</p>
<h2>Psalm 51</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of 
David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone to Bersabee. </h4>
<p><small>51:1 </small>Have mercy upon me, O God, 
according to thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of thy compassions 
blot out my transgression. <small>2
</small>Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from 
my sin. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>For I am conscious of mine 
iniquity; and my sin is continually before me. <small>4 </small>Against thee only have I sinned, 
and done evil before thee: that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and 
mightest overcome when thou art judged. <small>5 </small>
For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my 
mother conceive me. </p>
<p><small>6 </small>For, behold, thou lovest truth: thou hast manifested to me the secret and hidden 
things of thy wisdom.
<small>7 </small>Thou shalt sprinkle me with 
hyssop, and I shall be purified: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter 
than snow. <small>8 </small>Thou shalt cause 
me to hear gladness and joy: the afflicted bones shall rejoice. <small>9 </small>Turn away thy face from my sins, and blot 
out all mine iniquities. <small>10 </small>
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my 
inward parts. <small>11 </small>
Cast me not away from thy presence; and remove not thy holy Spirit from me. <small>12 </small>
Restore to me the joy of thy salvation: establish me with thy directing Spirit. </p>
<p><small>
13 </small> <i>Then</i> will I teach transgressors thy 
ways; and ungodly men shall turn to thee.
<small>14 </small>Deliver me from 
blood-guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation: <i>and</i> my tongue shall 
joyfully declare thy righteousness. <small>15 </small>
O Lord, thou shalt open my lips; and my mouth shall 
declare thy praise. <small>16 </small>For 
if thou desiredst sacrifice, I would have given <i>it</i>: thou wilt not take 
pleasure in whole-burnt-offerings. <small>17 </small>
Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart 
God will not despise. </p>
<p><small>18 </small>
Do good, O Lord, to Sion in thy good pleasure; and let the walls of 
Jerusalem be built. <small>19 </small>Then shalt thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, offering, and 
whole-burnt-sacrifices: then shall they offer calves upon thine altar.</p>
<h2>Psalm 52</h2>
<h4>For the end, <i>a Psalm</i> 
of instruction by David, when Doec the Idumean came and told Saul, and said to 
him, David is gone to the house of Abimelech.</h4>
<p><small>52:1 </small>Why dost thou, O mighty man, 
boast of iniquity in <i>thy</i> mischief? All the day <small>2
</small>thy tongue has devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened 
razor thou hast wrought deceit. <small>3 </small>
Thou hast loved wickedness more than goodness; unrighteousness 
better than to speak righteousness. Pause. <small>4 </small>Thou has loved all words of 
destruction, <i>and</i> a deceitful tongue. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>
Therefore may God destroy thee for ever, may he pluck thee 
up and utterly remove thee from <i>thy</i> dwelling, and thy root from the land 
of the living. Pause.<small> 6 </small>And the righteous shall see, and fear, 
and shall laugh at him, and say, <small>7 </small>
Behold the man who made not God his help; but trusted in the 
abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his vanity. </p>
<p>
<small>8 </small>But I am as a fruitful olive in the house 
of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever, even for evermore. <small>9 </small>I will give 
thanks to thee for ever, for thou hast done <i>it</i>: and I will wait on thy 
name; for <i>it is</i> good before the saints.</p>
<h2>Psalm 53</h2>
<h4>For the end, <i>a Psalm</i> 
of David upon Maeleth, of instruction.</h4>
<p><small>53:1 </small>The fool has said in his heart, There 
is no God. They have corrupted <i>themselves</i>, and become abominable in 
iniquities: there is none that does good. <small>2 </small>
God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there 
were any that understood, or sought after God. <small>3
</small>They have all gone out of the way, they are together 
become unprofitable; there is none that does good, there is not even one. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
Will none of the workers of iniquity know, who devour my people as they would 
eat bread? they have not called upon God. There were they greatly afraid, where 
there was no fear: <small>5 </small>or God has 
scattered the bones of the men-pleasers; they were ashamed, for God despised 
them. <small>6 </small>Who will bring the salvation of 
Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turns the captivity of his people, Jacob shall 
exult, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
<h2>Psalm 54</h2>
<h4>For the end, among Hymns 
of instruction by David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Lo, is not 
David hid with us?</h4>
<p><small>54:1 </small>Save me, O God, by thy name, and 
judge me by thy might.
<small>2 </small>O God, hear my prayer; hearken to 
the words of my mouth. <small>3 </small>
For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my life: they 
have not set God before them. Pause.</p>

<p><small>4 </small>For lo! God assists me; and the Lord 
is the helper of my soul. <small>5 </small>
He shall return evil to mine enemies; utterly destroy them in thy 
truth. <small>6 </small>I will 
willingly sacrifice to thee: I will give thanks to thy name, O Lord; for <i>it 
is</i> good. <small>7 </small>For thou hast 
delivered me out of all affliction, and mine eye has seen <i>my desire</i> upon 
mine enemies.</p>
<h2>Psalm 55</h2>
<h4>For the end, among Hymns of 
instruction by David.</h4>
<p><small>55:1 </small>Hearken, O God, to my prayer; and 
disregard not my supplication. <small>2 </small>
Attend to me, and hearken to me: I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled; <small>3 </small>because of the voice of the enemy, and 
because of the oppression of the sinner: for they brought iniquity against me, 
and were wrathfully angry with me. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
My heart was troubled within me; and the fear of death fell upon 
me. <small>5 </small>Fear and trembling came upon 
me, and darkness covered me. <small>6 </small>
And I said, O that I had wings as <i>those</i> of a dove! 
then would I flee away, and be at rest. <small>7 </small>
Lo! I have fled afar off, and lodged in the wilderness. Pause. <small>8 </small>
I waited for him that should deliver me from distress of spirit and tempest.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>Destroy, O Lord, and divide their 
tongues: for I have seen iniquity and gain saying in the city. <small>10 </small>Day and night he shall go round 
about it upon its walls: iniquity and sorrow and unrighteousness <i>are</i> in 
the midst of it; <small>11 </small>and usury and 
craft have not failed from its streets. </p>
<p><small>12
</small>For if an enemy had reproached me, I would have 
endured it; and if one who hated <i>me</i> had spoken vauntingly against me, I 
would have hid myself from him. <small>13 </small>
But thou, O man like minded, my guide, and my acquaintance, <small>14 </small>who in companionship with me 
sweetened <i>our</i> food: we walked in the house of God in concord. <small>15 </small>Let death come upon them, and let them 
go down alive into Hades, for iniquity is in their dwellings, in the midst of 
them.</p>

<p><small>16 </small>I cried to God, and the Lord 
hearkened to me. <small>17 </small>Evening, and morning, and at noon I will declare and make known <i>my wants</i>: 
and he shall hear my voice. <small>18 </small>
He shall deliver my soul in peace from them that draw nigh to me: for 
they were with me in many <i>cases</i>. <small>19 </small>
God shall hear, and bring them low, <i>even</i> he that 
has existed from eternity. Pause. </p>
<p>For they suffer no reverse, and <i>therefore</i> 
they have not feared God. <small>20 </small>He has 
reached forth his hand for retribution; they have profaned his covenant.
<small>21 </small>They were scattered at the anger 
of his countenance, and his heart drew nigh them. His words were smoother than 
oil, yet are they darts. </p>
<p><small>22 </small>
Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall 
never suffer the righteous to be moved. <small>23 </small>
But thou, O God, shalt bring them down to the pit of 
destruction; bloody and crafty men shall not live out half their days; but I 
will hope in thee, O Lord.</p>
<h2>Psalm 56</h2>
<h4>For the end, concerning 
the people that were removed from the sanctuary, by David for a memorial, when 
the Philistines caught him in Geth.</h4>
<p><small>56:1 </small>Have mercy upon me, O God; for man 
has trodden me down; all the day long he warring has afflicted me. <small>2 </small>Mine enemies have trodden me down all the 
day from the dawning of the day; for there are many warring against me.
</p>
<p><small>3 </small>They shall be afraid, but I will 
trust in thee. <small>4 </small>In God I will 
praise my words; all the day have I hoped in God; I will not fear what flesh 
shall do to me. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>All 
the day long they have abominated my words; all their devices <i>are</i> against 
me for evil. <small>6 </small>They will 
dwell near and hide <i>themselves</i>; they will watch my steps, accordingly as 
I have waited patiently in my soul. <small>7 </small>
Thou wilt on no account save them; thou wilt bring down the 
people in wrath.
<small>8 </small>O God, I have declared my life to 
thee; thou has set my tears before thee, even according to thy promise.
</p>
<p><small>9 </small>Mine enemies shall be turned back, 
in the day wherein I shall call upon thee; behold, I know that thou art my God. <small>10 </small>In God, will 
I praise <i>his</i> word; in the Lord will I praise <i>his</i> saying. <small>11 </small>I have hoped in God; I will not be 
afraid of what man shall do to me. <small>12 </small>
The vows of thy praise, O God, which I will pay, are upon me. <small>13 </small>
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from sliding, that I 
should be well-pleasing before God in the land of the living.</p>
<h2>Psalm 57</h2>
<h4>For the end. Destroy not: by 
David, for a memorial, when he fled from the presence of Saul to the cave. </h4>
<p><small>57:1 </small>Have mercy, upon me, O God, have 
mercy upon me: for my soul has trusted in thee: and in the shadow of thy wings 
will I hope, until the iniquity have passed away. <small>2 </small>
I will cry to God most high; the God who has benefited me. Pause. <small>3
</small>He sent from heaven and saved me; he gave to reproach them 
that trampled on me: God has sent forth his mercy and his truth;
<small>4 </small>and he has delivered my 
soul from the midst of <i>lions’</i>whelps: I lay down to sleep, <i>though</i> 
troubled. <i>As for</i> the sons of men, their teeth are arms and <i>missile</i> weapons, and their tongue a sharp sword. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all 
the earth. <small>6 </small>They 
have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a 
pit before my face, and fallen into it <i>themselves</i>. Pause.
<small>7 </small>My heart, O God, <i>is</i> 
ready, my heart <i>is</i> ready: I will sing, yea will sing psalms. <small>8 </small>Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and 
harp: I will awake early. <small>9 </small>
O Lord, I will give thanks to thee among the nations: I will sing to thee among 
the Gentiles. <small>10 </small>For thy mercy has 
been magnified even to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds.
<small>11 </small>Be thou exalted, O God, above the 
heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.</p>
<h2>Psalm 58</h2>
<h4>For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a 
memorial.</h4>
<p><small>58:1 </small>If ye do indeed speak righteousness, <i>then</i> 
do ye judge rightly, ye sons of men. <small>2 </small>
For ye work iniquities in <i>your</i> hearts in the earth: 
your hands plot unrighteousness. <small>3 </small>
Sinners have gone astray from the womb: they go astray from the belly: they 
speak lies. <small>4 </small>Their 
venom is like <i>that</i> of a serpent; as <i>that</i> of a deaf asp, and that 
stops her ears; <small>5 </small>which will 
not hear the voice of charmers, nor <i>heed</i> the charm prepared skillfully by 
the wise.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>God has crushed their teeth in their 
mouth: God has broken the cheek-teeth of the lions. <small>7 </small>They shall utterly pass away like water 
running through: he shall bend his bow till they shall fail. <small>8 </small>They shall be destroyed as melted wax: 
the fire has fallen and they have not seen the sun. <small>9
</small>Before your thorns feel the white thorn, he shall swallow 
you up as living, as in his wrath. </p>
<p><small>10 </small>
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance of the 
ungodly: he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner. <small>11 </small>And a man shall say, Verily then there 
is a reward for the righteous: verily there is a God that judges them in the 
earth.</p>
<h2>Psalm 59</h2>
<h4>For the end. Destroy not: by David 
for a memorial, when Saul sent, and watched his house to kill him.</h4>
<p><small>59:1 </small>Deliver me from mine enemies, O 
God; and ransom me from those that rise up against me. <small>2 </small>
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. </p>
<p>
<small>3 </small>For, behold, they have hunted 
after my soul; violent men have set upon me: neither <i>is it</i> my iniquity, 
nor my sin, O Lord. <small>4 </small>Without 
iniquity I ran and directed <i>my course aright</i>: awake to help me, and 
behold. <small>5 </small>And thou, Lord God of 
hosts, the God of Israel, draw nigh to visit all the heathen; pity not any that 
work iniquity. Pause. <small>6 </small>They shall 
return at evening, and hunger like a dog, and go round about the city. </p>
<p><small>7 </small>Behold, they shall 
utter a voice with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips; for who, <i>say 
they</i>, has heard?
<small>8 </small>But thou, Lord, wilt laugh 
them to scorn; thou wilt utterly set at nought all the heathen. <small>9</small> will keep my strength, <i>
looking</i> to thee; for thou, O God, art my helper. <small>10
</small> <i>As for</i> my God, his mercy shall go before 
me: my God will shew me <i>vengeance</i> on mine enemies. </p>
<p><small>
11 </small>Slay them not, lest they forget thy law; scatter them 
by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord, my defender. <small>12 </small> <i>For</i> the sin of their 
mouth, <i>and</i> the word of their lips, let them be even taken in their pride.
<small>13 </small>And for <i>their</i> 
cursing and falsehood shall utter destruction be denounced: <i>they shall fall</i> 
by the wrath of utter destruction, and shall not be; so shall they know that the 
God of Jacob is Lord of the ends of the earth. Pause. <small>14
</small>They shall return at evening, and be hungry as a dog, and 
go round about the city. <small>15 </small>
They shall be scattered hither and thither for meat; and if they 
be not satisfied, they shall even murmur. </p>
<p><small>16
</small>But I will sing to thy strength, and in the 
morning will I exult <i>in</i> thy mercy; for thou hast been my supporter, and 
my refuge in the day of mine affliction. <small>17 </small>
 <i>Thou art</i> my helper; to thee, my God, will I sing; 
thou art my supporter, O my God, <i>and</i> my mercy.</p>
<h2>Psalm 60</h2>
<h4>For the end, for them 
that shall yet be changed; for an inscription by David for instruction, when he
<i>had</i> burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syria Sobal, and Joab <i>had</i> 
returned and smitten <i>in</i> the valley of salt twelve thousand.</h4>
<p><small>60:1 </small>O God, thou hast rejected and 
destroyed us; thou hast been angry, yet hast pitied us. <small>2 </small>Thou hast shaken the earth, and troubled 
it; heal its breaches, for it has been shaken. <small>3
</small>Thou hast shewn thy people hard things: thou has 
made us drink the wine of astonishment. <small>4 </small>
Thou hast given a token to them that fear thee, that they might 
flee from the bow. Pause. <small>5 </small>
That thy beloved ones may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>God has spoken in his 
holiness; I will rejoice, and divide Sicima, and measure out the valley of 
tents. <small>7 </small>Galaad is mine, and 
Manasse is mine; and Ephraim is the strength of my head; <small>8
</small>Judas is my king; Moab is the caldron of my hope; 
over Idumea will I stretch out my shoe; the Philistines have been subjected to 
me. </p>
<p><small>9 </small>Who will lead me into 
the fortified city? who will guide me as far a Idumea? <small>10
</small>Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not 
thou, O God, go forth with our forces? <small>11 </small>
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the deliverance of man. </p>
<p><small>12 </small>In God will we do 
valiantly; and he shall bring to nought them that harass us.</p>
<h2>Psalm 61</h2>
<h4>For the end, among the Hymns of 
David. </h4>
<p><small>61:1 </small>O God, hearken to my petition; 
attend to my prayer. <small>2 </small>From the ends of the earth have I 
cried to thee, when my heart was in trouble: thou liftedst me up on a rock thou 
didst guide me: <small>3 </small>because thou wert 
my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. <small>4 </small>I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; 
I will shelter myself under the shadow of thy wings. Pause.</p>

<p><small>5 </small>For thou, o God, hast heard my 
prayers; thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name. <small>6 </small>Thou shalt add days to the days of 
the king; <i>thou shalt lengthen</i> his years to all generations. <small>7 </small>He shall endure for ever before God: 
which of them will seek out his mercy and truth? <small>8
</small>So will I sing to thy name for ever and ever, that I may 
daily perform my vows.</p>

<h2>Psalm 62</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of 
David for Idithun.</h4>
<p><small>62:1 </small>Shall not my soul be subjected to 
God? for of him is my salvation. <small>2 </small>For he is my 
God, and my saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved very much. <small>3 </small>How long will ye assault a man? ye are 
all slaughtering as with a bowed wall and a broken hedge. <small>4 </small>They only took counsel to set at nought mine honour: I ran in thirst: with their mouth they blessed, but with 
their heart they cursed. Pause. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>
Nevertheless do thou, my soul, be subjected to God; for of him <i>is</i> 
my patient hope. <small>6 </small>For he <i>
is</i> my God and my Saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved. <small>7 </small>In God <i>is</i> my salvation and 
my glory: <i>he is</i> the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
<small>8 </small>Hope in him, all ye congregation of 
the people; pour out your hearts before him, for God is our helper. Pause. </p>
<p><small>9 </small>But the sons 
of men are vain; the sons of men are false, so as to be deceitful in the 
balances; they are all alike <i>formed</i> out of vanity. <small>
10 </small>Trust not in unrighteousness, and lust not after 
robberies: if wealth should flow in, set not your heart upon it. <small>11 </small>God has spoken once, <i>and</i> 
I have heard these two things, that power is of God; <small>12
</small>and mercy is thine, O Lord; for thou wilt 
recompense every one according to his works.</p>

<h2>Psalm 63</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David, when 
he was in the wilderness of Idumea.</h4>
<p><small>63:1 </small>O God, my God, I cry to thee early; my 
soul has thirsted for thee: how often has my flesh <i>longed</i> after thee, in 
a barren and trackless and dry land! <small>2 </small>
Thus have I appeared before thee in the sanctuary, that I might 
see thy power and thy glory.
<small>3 </small>For thy mercy is better than life: my 
lips shall praise thee. <small>4 </small>
Thus will I bless thee during my life: I will lift up my hands in thy name. <small>5 </small>Let my soul be filled 
as with marrow and fatness; and <i>my</i> joyful lips shall praise thy name.
</p>
<p><small>6 </small>Forasmuch as I have remembered 
thee on my bed: in the early seasons I have meditated on thee.
<small>7 </small>For thou hast been my helper, and in 
the shelter of thy wings will I rejoice. <small>8 </small>
My soul has kept very close behind thee: thy right hand has 
upheld me. <small>9 </small>But they vainly sought 
after my soul; they shall go into the lowest parts o the earth.
<small>10 </small>They shall be delivered up to the 
power of the sword; they shall be portions for foxes. <small>11 </small>But the king shall rejoice in God; every 
one that swears by him shall be praised; for the mouth of them that speak unjust 
things has been stopped.</p>

<h2>Psalm 64</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>64:1 </small>Hear my prayer, O God, when I make 
my petition to thee; deliver my soul from fear of the enemy. <small>2 </small>
Thou hast sheltered me from the conspiracy of them that do wickedly; from the 
multitude of them that work iniquity; <small>3 </small>
who have sharpened their tongues as a sword; they have bent their 
bow maliciously; <small>4 </small>to shoot in 
secret at the blameless; they will shoot him suddenly, and will not fear. <small>5 </small>
They have set up for themselves an evil matter, they have given counsel to hide 
snares; they have said, Who shall see them? <small>6 </small>They have searched out iniquity; they have wearied themselves with searching 
diligently, a man shall approach and the heart is deep,
<small>7 </small>and God shall be exalted, 
their wounds were <i>caused by</i> the weapon of the foolish children, <small>8 </small>and their tongues have set him at nought, all that saw them were troubled; <small>9 </small>
and every man was alarmed, and they related the works of God, and 
understood his deeds. <small>10 </small>
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and hope on him, and all the upright in 
heart shall be praised.</p>

<h2>Psalm 65</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm <i>
and</i> Song of David.</h4>
<p><small>65:1 </small>Praise becomes thee, O God, in Sion; and to thee shall 
the vow be performed. <small>2 </small>Hear my 
prayer; to thee all flesh shall come. <small>3 </small>
The words of transgressors have overpowered us; but do thou 
pardon our sins. <small>4 </small>Blessed <i>is he</i> whom thou hast chosen and adopted; he shall dwell in thy 
courts; we shall be filled with the good things of thy house; thy temple is 
holy. <small>5 </small> <i>Thou art</i> 
wonderful in righteousness. Hearken to us, O God our Saviour; the hope of all 
the ends of the earth, and of them <i>that are</i> on the sea afar off:
<small>6 </small>who dost establish the mountains in 
thy strength, being girded about with power; <small>
7 </small>who troublest the depth of the sea, the sounds of 
its waves. <small>8 </small>The nations 
shall be troubled, and they that inhabit the ends <i>of the earth</i> shall be 
afraid of thy signs; thou wilt cause the outgoings of morning and evening to 
rejoice. </p>
<p><small>9 </small>Thou hast visited 
the earth, and saturated it; thou hast abundantly enriched it. The river of God 
is filled with water; thou hast prepared their food, for thus is the preparation
<i>of it</i>. <small>10 </small>Saturate 
her furrows, multiply her fruits; <i>the crop</i> springing up shall rejoice in 
its drops. <small>11 </small>Thou wilt 
bless the crown of the year <i>because</i> of thy goodness; and thy plains shall 
be filled with fatness. <small>12 </small>The 
mountains of the wilderness shall be enriched; and the hills shall gird 
themselves with joy. <small>13 </small>The 
rams of the flock are clothed <i>with wool</i>, and the valleys shall abound in 
corn; they shall cry aloud, yea they shall sing hymns.</p>

<h2>Psalm 66</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Song of Psalm of 
resurrection.</h4>
<p><small>66:1 </small>Shout unto God, all the earth. <small>2
</small>O sing praises to his name; give glory to his praise. <small>3 </small>Say unto God, How 
awful are thy works! through the greatness of thy power thine enemies shall lie 
to thee. <small>4 </small>Let all the earth worship 
thee, and sing to thee; let them sing to thy name. Pause. </p>
<p>
<small>5 </small>Come and behold the works of God;
<i>he is</i> terrible in <i>his</i> counsels beyond the children of men. <small>6 </small>Who turns the sea into dry land; they 
shall go through the river on foot; there shall we rejoice in him, <small>7 </small>who by his power is Lord over the 
age, his eyes look upon the nations; let not them that provoke <i>him</i> be 
exalted in themselves. Pause.</p>

<p><small>8 </small>Bless our God, ye Gentiles, and make 
the voice of his praise to be heard; <small>9 </small>
who quickens my soul in life, and does not suffer my feet to be 
moved. <small>10 </small>For thou, O God, has 
proved us; thou hast tried us with fire as silver is tried. <small>11 </small>Thou broughtest us into the 
snare; thou laidest afflictions on our back. <small>12 </small>
Thou didst mount men upon our heads; we went through the 
fire and water; but thou broughtest us out into <i>a place of</i> refreshment.</p>

<p><small>13 </small>I will go into thine house 
with whole-burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows, <small>14
</small>which my lips framed, and my mouth uttered in my 
affliction. <small>15 </small>I will offer to thee 
whole-burnt-sacrifices full of marrow, with incense and rams; I will sacrifice 
to thee oxen with goats. Pause. </p>
<p><small>16 </small>
Come, hear, and I will tell, all ye that fear God, how great 
things he has done for my soul. <small>17 </small>
I cried to him with my mouth, and exalted him with my tongue. <small>18 </small>If I have 
regarded iniquity in my heart, let not the Lord hearken <i>to me</i>. <small>19 </small>Therefore God has hearkened to me; he 
has attended to the voice of my prayer. <small>20 </small>
Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy 
from me.</p>

<h2>Psalm 67</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David 
among the Hymns.</h4>
<p><small>67:1 </small>God be merciful to us, and bless us; <i>and</i> cause 
his face to shine upon us. Pause. <small>2 </small>
That <i>men</i> may know thy way on the earth, thy salvation among all 
nations. <small>3 </small>Let the nations, O God, 
give thanks to thee; let all the nations give thanks to thee. <small>4 </small>Let the nations rejoice and exult, 
for thou shalt judge the peoples in equity, and shalt guide the nations on the 
earth. Pause. <small>5 </small>Let the peoples, O 
God, give thanks to thee; let all the peoples give thanks to thee.
<small>6 </small>The earth has yielded her fruit; 
let God, our God bless us. <small>7</small>
Let God bless us; and let all the ends of the earth fear him.</p>

<h2>Psalm 68</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of a Song by 
David.</h4>
<p><small>68:1 </small>Let God arise, and let his enemies 
be scattered; and let them that hate him flee from before him. <small>2 </small>
As smoke vanishes, let them vanish: as wax melts before the fire, 
so let the sinners perish from before God. <small>3
</small>But let the righteous rejoice; let them exult before God: 
let them be delighted with joy. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
Sing to God, sing praises to his name: make a way for him that 
rides upon the west (the Lord is his name) and exult before him. They shall be 
troubled before the face of him, <small>5 </small>
 <i>who is</i> the father of the orphans, and judge of the 
widows: <i>such is</i> God in his holy place. <small>6 </small>
God settles the solitary in a house; leading forth 
prisoners mightily, also them that act provokingly, <i>even</i> them that dwell 
in tombs.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>O God, when thou wentest 
forth before thy people, when thou wentest through the wilderness; Pause: <small>8 </small>the earth quaked, yea, the heavens 
dropped <i>water</i> at the presence of the God of Sina, at the presence of the 
God of Israel. <small>9 </small>O God, thou 
wilt grant to thine inheritance a gracious rain; for it was weary, but thou 
didst refresh it. </p>
<p><small>10 </small>Thy creatures 
dwell in it: thou hast in thy goodness prepared for the poor. <small>11 </small>The Lord God will give a word to 
them that preach <i>it</i> in a great company. <small>12 </small>
The king of the forces of the beloved, of the beloved, <i>
will</i> even <i>grant them</i> for the beauty of the house to divide the 
spoils. <small>13 </small>Even if ye should 
lie among the lots, <i>ye shall have</i> the wings of a dove covered with 
silver, and her breast with yellow gold. <small>14 </small>
When the heavenly One scatters kings upon it, they shall 
be made snow-white in Selmon.
<small>15 </small>The mountain of God is a rich 
mountain; a swelling mountain, a rich mountain. <small>16
</small>Wherefore do ye conceive <i>evil</i>, ye swelling 
mountains? <i>this is</i> the mountain which God has delighted to dwell in; yea, 
the Lord will dwell <i>in it</i> for ever. </p>
<p><small>17 </small>
The chariots of God are ten thousand fold, thousands of 
rejoicing ones: the Lord is among them, in Sina, in the holy place. <small>18 </small>Thou art gone up on high, thou 
hast led captivity captive, thou hast received gifts for man, yea, for <i>they 
were</i> rebellious, that thou mightest dwell among them. </p>
<p><small>
19 </small>Blessed be the Lord God, blessed be the Lord daily; and 
the God of our salvation shall prosper us. Pause. <small>20 </small>Our God is the God of salvation; and to 
the Lord belong the issues from death. <small>21 </small>
But God shall crust the heads of his enemies; the hairy crown of 
them that go on in their trespasses.
<small>22 </small>The Lord said, I will bring 
again from Basan, I will bring <i>my people</i> again through the depths of the 
sea. <small>23 </small>That thy foot may be 
dipped in blood, <i>and</i> the tongue of thy dogs <i>be stained</i> with that 
of <i>thine</i> enemies. </p>
<p><small>24 </small>Thy 
goings, O God, have been seen; the goings of my God, the king, in the sanctuary. <small>25 </small>The princes 
went first, next before the players on instruments, in the midst of damsels 
playing on timbrels. <small>26 </small>Praise God 
in the congregations, the Lord from the fountains of Israel. <small>27 </small>There is Benjamin the younger <i>
one</i> in ecstasy, the princes of Juda their rulers, the princes of Zabulon, 
the princes of Nephthali. </p>
<p><small>28 </small>O God, 
command thou thy strength: strengthen, O God, this which thou hast wrought in 
us. <small>29 </small>Because of thy temple at 
Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to thee. <small>30 </small>Rebuke the wild beasts of the 
reed: let the crowd of bulls with the heifers of the nations <i>be rebuked</i>, 
so that they who have been proved with silver may not be shut out: scatter thou 
the nations that wish for wars. <small>31 </small>
Ambassadors shall arrive out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten <i>to 
stretch out</i> her hand readily to God.</p>
<p><small>32 </small>Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the 
earth; sing psalms to the Lord. Pause. <small>33 </small>
Sing to God that rides on the heaven of heaven, eastward: lo, he 
will utter a mighty sound with his voice. <small>34 </small>
Give ye glory to God: his excellency is over Israel, and 
his power is in the clouds. <small>35 </small>
God is wonderful in his holy <i>places</i>, the God of Israel: he will 
give power and strength to his people: blessed be God.</p>
<h2>Psalm 69</h2>
<h4>For the end, <i>a Psalm</i> 
of David, for alternate <i>strains</i>.</h4>
<p><small>69:1 </small>Save me, O God; for the waters have 
come in to my soul. <small>2 </small>I am stuck 
fast in deep mire, and there is no standing: I am come in to the depths of the 
sea, and a storm has overwhelmed me. <small>3 </small>
I am weary <i>of</i> crying, my throat has become hoarse; 
mine eyes have failed by my waiting on my God. <small>4 </small>
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs 
of my head: my enemies that persecute me unrighteously are strengthened: then I 
restored that which I took not away. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>
O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my transgressions 
are not hidden from thee. <small>6 </small>Let not 
them that wait on thee, O Lord of hosts, be ashamed on my account: let not them 
that seek thee, be ashamed on my account, O God of Israel. <small>7 </small>For I have suffered reproach for thy 
sake; shame has covered my face. <small>8 </small>
I became strange to my brethren, and a stranger to my mother’s 
children. <small>9 </small>For the 
zeal of thine house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached 
thee are fallen upon me. <small>10 </small>And I 
bowed down my soul with fasting, and that was made my reproach. <small>11 </small>And I put on sackcloth for my covering; 
and I became a proverb to them. <small>12 </small>
They that sit in the gate talked against me, and they that drank 
wine sang against me.</p>

<p><small>13 </small>But I <i>will cry</i> to 
thee, O Lord, in my prayer; O God, it is a propitious time: in the multitude of 
thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. <small>14
</small>Save me from the mire, that I stick not <i>in it</i>: 
let me be delivered from them that hate me, and from the deep waters. <small>15 </small>Let not the waterflood drown me, 
nor let the deep swallow me up; neither let the well shut its mouth upon me.
<small>16 </small>Hear me, O Lord; for thy mercy is 
good: according to the multitude of thy compassions look upon me.
<small>17 </small>And turn not away thy face from 
thy servant; for I am afflicted: hear me speedily. <small>18 </small>Draw nigh to my soul and redeem it: 
deliver me because of mine enemies. </p>
<p><small>19 </small>
For thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my 
confusion; all that afflict me are before thee. <small>20 </small>
My soul has waited for reproach and misery; and I waited for one 
to grieve with me, but there was none; and for one to comfort me, but I found 
none. <small>21 </small>They gave <i>
me</i> also gall for my food, and made me drink vinegar for my thirst.
<small>22 </small>Let their table before them be for a 
snare, and for a recompense, and for a stumbling-block. <small>23 </small>Let their eyes be darkened that they 
should not see; and bow down their back continually. <small>
24 </small>Pour out thy wrath upon them, and let the fury 
of thine anger take hold on them. <small>25 </small>
Let their habitation be made desolate; and let there be no 
inhabitant in their tents: <small>26 </small>
Because they persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the 
grief of my wounds. <small>27 </small>
Add iniquity to their iniquity; and let them not come into thy righteousness. <small>28 </small>
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and let them not be written 
with the righteous. </p>
<p><small>29 </small>I am poor and 
sorrowful; but the salvation of thy countenance has helped me.
<small>30 </small>I will praise the name of my God with 
a song, I will magnify him with praise; <small>31
</small>and <i>this</i> shall please God more than a young 
calf having horns and hoofs. <small>32 </small>
Let the poor see and rejoice; seek the Lord diligently, and ye shall live. <small>33 </small>For the Lord hears 
the poor, and does not set at nought his fettered ones. <small>34
</small>Let the heavens and the earth raise him, the sea, and all 
things moving in them. <small>35 </small>
For God will save Sion, and the cities of Judea shall be built; and <i>
men</i> shall dwell there, and inherit it. <small>36 </small>
And the seed of his servants shall possess it, and they that love 
his name shall dwell therein.</p>

<h2>Psalm 70</h2>
<h4>For the end, by David for a 
remembrance, that the Lord may save me.</h4>
<p><small>70:1 </small>Draw nigh, O God, to my help.
<small>2 </small>Let them be ashamed and confounded 
that seek my soul: let them be turned backward and put to shame, that wish me 
evil. <small>3 </small>Let them that say to me, 
Aha, aha, be turned back and put to shame immediately. <small>4 </small>Let all that seek thee exult and be glad 
in thee: and let those that love thy salvation say continually, Let God be 
magnified. <small>5 </small>But I am poor and 
needy; O God, help me: thou art my helper and deliverer, O Lord, delay not.</p>

<p><small>71:1 </small> O Lord, I have hoped in thee: 
let me never be put to shame. <small>
2 </small>In thy righteousness deliver me and rescue me: 
incline thine ear to me, and save me. <small>3 </small>
Be to me a protecting God, and a strong hold to save me: for thou 
art my fortress and my refuge. <small>4 </small>
Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the sinner, from the hand 
of the transgressor and unjust man. <small>5 </small>
For thou art my support, O Lord; O Lord, <i>thou art</i> 
my hope from my youth. <small>6 </small>On thee 
have I been stayed from the womb: from the belly of my mother thou art my 
protector: of thee is my praise continually. </p>
<p><small>7 </small>
I am become as it were a wonder to many: but thou art <i>
my</i> strong helper. <small>8 </small>Let 
my mouth be filled with praise, that I may hymn thy glory, <i>and</i> thy 
majesty all the day. <small>9 </small>Cast me not 
off at the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails. <small>10 </small>For mine enemies have spoken against me; 
and they that lay wait for my soul have taken counsel together,
<small>11 </small>saying, God has forsaken 
him: persecute ye and take him; for there is none to deliver <i>him</i>. <small>12 </small>O God, go not far from me, O my God, 
draw nigh to my help. <small>13 </small>
Let those that plot against my soul be ashamed and utterly fail: let 
those that seek my hurt be clothed with shame and dishonour.</p>

<p><small>14 </small>But I will hope continually, and will 
praise thee more and more. <small>15 </small>
My mouth shall declare thy righteousness openly, <i>and</i> 
thy salvation all the day; for I am not acquainted with the affairs <i>of men</i>.
<small>16 </small>I will go on in the might of the 
Lord: O Lord, I will make mention of thy righteousness only. <small>17 </small>O God, thou hast taught me from my 
youth, and until now will I declare thy wonders; <small>18
</small>even until I am old and advanced in years. O God, 
forsake me not; until I shall have declared thine arm to all the generation that 
is to come: <small>19 </small>even thy 
power and thy righteousness, O God, up to the highest <i>heavens, even</i> the 
mighty works which thou has done: O God, who is like to thee? </p>
<p>
<small>20 </small>What afflictions many and sore 
hast thou shewed me! yet thou didst turn and quicken me, and broughtest me again 
from the depths of the earth. <small>21 </small>
Thou didst multiply thy righteousness, and didst turn and comfort me, 
and broughtest me again out of the depths of the earth. <small>22
</small>I will also therefore give thanks to thee, O God,
<i>because of</i> thy truth, on an instrument of psalmody: I will sing psalms to 
thee on the harp, O Holy One of Israel. <small>23 </small>
My lips shall rejoice when I sing to thee; and my soul, which 
thou hast redeemed. <small>24 </small>Moreover also 
my tongue shall dwell all the day upon thy righteousness; when they shall be 
ashamed and confounded that seek my hurt.</p>

<h2>Psalm 72</h2>
<h4>For Solomon.</h4>
<p><small>72:1 </small>O God, give thy judgment to the 
king, and thy righteousness to the king’s son;
<small>2 </small> <i>that he may</i> judge thy 
people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. </p>
<p><small>3
</small>Let the mountains and the hills raise peace to thy people: <small>4 </small>
he shall judge the poor of the people in righteousness, and save the children of 
the needy; and shall bring low the false accuser. <small>5 </small>
And he shall continue as long as the sun, and before the moon for 
ever. <small>6 </small>He shall come down as rain 
upon a fleece; and as drops falling upon the earth. <small>7 </small>In his days shall righteousness spring 
up; and abundance of peace till the moon be removed. <small>8 </small>And he shall have dominion from sea to 
sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. <small>9
</small>The Ethiopians shall fall down before him; and his enemies 
shall lick the dust. <small>10 </small>
The kings of Tharsis, and the isles, shall bring presents: the kings of 
the Arabians and Saba shall offer gifts. <small>11 </small>
And all kings shall worship him; all the Gentiles shall serve 
him. <small>12 </small>For he has delivered the 
poor from the oppressor; and the needy who had no helper. <small>13 </small>He shall spare the poor and needy, and 
shall deliver the souls of the needy. <small>14 </small>
He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice: and 
their name <i>shall be</i> precious before him. <small>15 </small>
And he shall live, and there shall be given him of the 
gold of Arabia: and <i>men</i> shall pray for him continually; <i>and</i> all 
the day shall they praise him. <small>16 </small>
There shall be an establishment on the earth on the tops of the 
mountains: the fruit thereof shall be exalted above Libanus, and they of the 
city shall flourish as grass of the earth. </p>
<p><small>17 </small>
Let his name be blessed for ever: his name shall endure longer 
than the sun: and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in him: all 
nations shall call him blessed.</p>

<p><small>18 </small>Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, 
who alone does wonders. <small>19 </small>
And blessed is his glorious name for ever, even for ever and ever: and all the 
earth shall be filled with his glory. So be it, so be it. <small>20 </small>The hymns of David the son of Jessae are ended.</p>
<h2>Psalm 73</h2>
<h4>A Psalm for Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>73:1 </small>How good is God to Israel, to the 
upright in heart! <small>2 </small>
But my feet were almost overthrown; my goings very nearly 
slipped. <small>3 </small>For I was jealous of the 
transgressors, beholding the tranquility of sinners. </p>
<p>
<small>4 </small>For there is no sign of reluctance 
in their death: and <i>they have</i> firmness under their affliction. <small>5 </small>They are not in the troubles of <i>
other</i> men; and they shall not be scourged with <i>other</i> men. <small>6 </small>Therefore pride has possessed them; they 
have clothed themselves with their injustice and ungodliness. <small>7 </small>Their injustice shall go forth as out of 
fatness: they have fulfilled their intention. <small>8
</small>They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they 
have uttered unrighteousness loftily. <small>9 </small>
They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has 
gone through upon the earth. <small>10 </small>
Therefore shall my people return hither: and full days shall be found with them. <small>11 </small>
And they said, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? <small>12 </small>Behold, these <i>are</i> the 
sinners, and they that prosper always: they have possessed wealth. </p>
<p>
<small>13 </small>And I said, Verily in vain have 
I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocency. <small>14
</small>For I was plagued all the day, and my reproof <i>
was</i> every morning.
<small>15 </small>If I said, I will speak 
thus; behold, I <i>should</i> have broken covenant with the generation of thy 
children. <small>16 </small>And I undertook 
to understand this, <i>but</i> it is too hard for me, <small>17
</small>until I go into the sanctuary of God; <i>and so</i> 
understand the latter end. </p>
<p><small>18 </small>
Surely thou hast appointed <i>judgments</i> to them because of their 
crafty dealings: thou hast cast them down when they were lifted up. <small>19 </small>How have they become desolate! suddenly 
they have failed: they have perished because of their iniquity. <small>20 </small>As the dream of one awakening, O Lord, 
in thy city thou wilt despise their image.</p>

<p><small>21 </small>For my heart has rejoiced, and my 
reins have been gladdened. <small>22 </small>
But I <i>was</i> vile and knew not: I became brutish 
before thee. <small>23 </small>Yet I am 
continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand. <small>24
</small>Thou hast guided me by thy counsel, and thou hast taken me 
to thyself with glory. <small>25 </small>
For what have I in heaven <i>but thee</i>? and what have I desired upon 
the earth beside thee? <small>26 </small>My 
heart and my flesh have failed: <i>but</i> God <i>is the strength</i> of my 
heart, and God is my portion for ever. </p>
<p><small>27 </small>
For, behold, they that remove themselves far from thee shall 
perish: thou hast destroyed every one that goes a whoring from thee.
<small>28 </small>But it is good for me to 
cleave close to God, to put my trust in the Lord; that I may proclaim all thy 
praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.</p>

<h2>Psalm 74</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of 
instruction for Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>74:1 </small>Wherefore hast thou rejected <i>us</i>, O God, for 
ever? <i>wherefore</i> is thy wrath kindled against the sheep of thy pasture?
<small>2 </small>Remember thy congregation 
which thou hast purchased from the beginning; thou didst ransom the rod of thine 
inheritance; this mount Sion wherein thou hast dwelt. <small>3
</small>Lift up thine hands against their pride 
continually; <i>because of</i> all that the enemy has done wickedly in thy holy 
places. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>And they that hate thee 
have boasted in the midst of thy feast; they have set up their standards for 
signs, <small>5 </small>ignorantly as it were in 
the entrance above; <small>6 </small>they cut down 
its doors at once with axes as in a wood of trees; they have broken it down with 
hatchet and stone cutter. <small>7 </small>
They have burnt thy sanctuary with fire to the ground; they have 
profaned the habitation of thy name. <small>8 </small>
They have said in their heart, <i>even</i> all their 
kindred together, Come, let us abolish the feasts of the Lord from the earth.
<small>9 </small>We have not seen our signs; 
there is no longer a prophet; and <i>God</i> will not know us any more. </p>
<p>
<small>10 </small>How long, O God, shall the enemy 
reproach? shall the enemy provoke thy name forever? <small>11
</small>Wherefore turnest thou away thine hand, and thy 
right hand from the midst of thy bosom for ever?
<small>12 </small>But God is our King of old; he has 
wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. <small>13
</small>Thou didst establish the sea, in thy might, thou didst 
break to pieces the heads of the dragons in the water. <small>14 </small>Thou didst break to pieces the 
heads of the dragon; thou didst give him <i>for</i> meat to the Ethiopian 
nations. <small>15 </small>Thou didst 
cleave fountains and torrents; thou driedst up mighty rivers. <small>16 </small>The day is thine, and the night 
is thine; thou hast prepared the sun and the moon. <small>17
</small>Thou hast made all the borders of the earth; thou hast 
made summer and spring.</p>

<p><small>18 </small>Remember this thy creation: an enemy 
has reproached the Lord, and a foolish people has provoked thy name.
<small>19 </small>Deliver not to the wild beasts a 
soul that gives praise to thee: forget not for ever the souls of thy poor. <small>20 </small>Look upon thy 
covenant: for the dark <i>places</i> of the earth are filled with the 
habitations of iniquity. <small>21 </small>let not 
the afflicted and shamed one be rejected: the poor and needy shall praise thy 
name. <small>22 </small>Arise, O God, plead thy 
cause: remember thy reproaches that come from the foolish one all the day. <small>23 </small>
Forget not the voice of thy suppliants: let the pride of them that hate thee 
continually ascend before thee.</p>

<h2>Psalm 75</h2>
<h4>For the end, Destroy 
not, a Psalm of a Song for Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>75:1 </small>We will give thanks to thee, O God, 
we will give thanks, and call upon thy name: I will declare all thy wonderful 
works.
<small>2 </small>When I shall take a set time, I 
will judge righteously. <small>3 </small>
The earth is dissolved, and all that dwell in it: I have strengthened its 
pillars. Pause. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>I said unto the 
transgressors, Do not transgress; and to the sinners, Lift not up the horn.
<small>5 </small>Lift not up your horn on high; 
speak not unrighteousness against God.
<small>6 </small>For <i>good comes</i> neither 
from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert mountains. <small>7 </small>For God is the judge; he puts down one, 
and raises up another. <small>8 </small>For <i>there is</i> a cup in the hand of the Lord, full of unmingled wine; and 
he has turned <i>it</i> from side to side, but its dregs have not been wholly 
poured out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink <i>them</i>. </p>
<p>
<small>9 </small>But I will exult for ever: I will sing 
praises to the God of Jacob. <small>10 </small>
And I will break all the horns of sinners; but the horns of the 
righteous one shall be exalted.</p>

<h2>Psalm 76</h2>
<h4>For the end, among the 
Hymns, a Psalm for Asaph; a Song for the Assyrian.</h4>
<p><small>76:1 </small>God is known in Judea: his name is 
great in Israel. <small>2 </small>And his place has been in peace, and his dwelling-place in Sion. <small>3 </small>There he broke the power of the bows, the 
shield, and the sword, and the battle. Pause. </p>
<p><small>4
</small>Thou dost wonderfully shine forth from the everlasting 
mountains. <small>5 </small>All the simple ones in 
heart were troubled; all the men of wealth have slept their sleep, and have 
found nothing in their hands. <small>6 </small>
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, the riders on horses slumbered.
<small>7 </small>Thou art terrible; and who 
shall withstand thee, because of thine anger? <small>8 </small>
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth 
feared, and was still, <small>9 </small>
when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek in heart. Pause. </p>
<p>
<small>10 </small>For the inward thought of man shall give 
thanks to thee: and the memorial of his inward thought shall keep a feast to 
thee. <small>11 </small>Vow, and 
pay <i>your vows</i> to the Lord our God; all that are round about him shall 
bring gifts, <i>even</i> to him that is terrible, <small>12
</small>and that takes away the spirits of princes; to him that is 
terrible among the kings of the earth.</p>
<h2>Psalm 77</h2>
<h4>For the end, for Idithun, 
a Psalm of Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>77:1 </small>I cried to the Lord with my voice, yea, my voice <i>was 
addressed</i> to God; and he gave heed to me. <small>2 </small>
In the day of mine affliction I earnestly sought the Lord;
<i>even</i> with my hands by night before him, and I was not deceived; my soul 
refused to be comforted. <small>3 </small>I 
remembered God, and rejoiced; I poured out my complaint, and my soul fainted. 
Pause. <small>4 </small>All mine enemies set 
a watch <i>against me</i>: I was troubled, and spoke not. </p>
<p><small>
5 </small>I considered the days of old, and remembered ancient 
years. <small>6 </small>And I 
meditated; I communed with my heart by night, and diligently searched my spirit,
<i>saying</i>, <small>7 </small>Will the Lord cast 
off for ever? and will he be well pleased no more? <small>8 </small>Will he cut off his mercy for ever, even 
for ever and ever? <small>9 </small>
Will God forget to pity? or will he shut up his compassions in his wrath? Pause. </p>
<p><small>10 </small>
And I said, Now I have begun; this is the change of the right hand of the Most 
High.
<small>11 </small>I remembered the works of the Lord; 
for I will remember thy wonders from the beginning. <small>12 </small>And I will meditate on all thy works, 
and will consider thy doings. </p>
<p><small>13 </small>
O God, thy way is in the sanctuary; who is a great God as our 
God? <small>14 </small>Thou art the God that doest 
wonders; thou hast made known thy power among the nations. <small>15 </small>Thou hast with thine arm 
redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Pause. <small>
16 </small>The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and 
feared; and the depths were troubled. <small>17 </small>
 <i>There was</i> an abundant sound of waters: the clouds 
uttered a voice; for thine arrows went abroad. <small>18 </small>
The voice of thy thunder was abroad, and around thy lightnings appeared to the world; the earth trembled a quaked. <small>19 </small>Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in 
many waters, and thy footsteps cannot be known. <small>
20 </small>Thou didst guide thy people as sheep by the hand of 
Moses and Aaron.</p>

<h2>Psalm 78</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of 
instruction for Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>78:1 </small>Give heed, O my people, to my law: 
incline your ear to the words of my mouth. <small>2 </small>I 
will open my mouth in parables: I will utter dark sayings <i>which have been</i> 
from the beginning. <small>3 </small>All which we 
have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us. <small>4 </small>They were not hid from their 
children to a second generations; <i>the fathers</i> declaring the praises of 
the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought. </p>
<p>
<small>5 </small>And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, 
and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known 
to their children: <small>6 </small>that another 
generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise 
and declare them to their children. <small>7 </small>
That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works 
of God, but diligently seek his commandments. <small>8
</small>That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and 
provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart aright, and its 
spirit was not steadfast with God.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>The children of Ephraim, 
bending and shooting <i>with</i> the bow, turned <i>back</i> in the day of 
battle. <small>10 </small>They kept not the 
covenant of God, and would not walk in his law. <small>11 </small>
And they forgot his benefits, and his miracles which he
<i>had</i> shewed them; <small>12 </small>the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the 
plain of Tanes. <small>13 </small>He clave 
the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as <i>in</i> a 
bottle. <small>14 </small>And he guided them with a 
cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire. <small>15</small> he clave a rock in the wilderness, and 
made them drink as in a great deep. <small>16
</small>And he brought water out of the rock, and caused waters to 
flow down as rivers. </p>
<p><small>17 </small>
And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the 
wilderness. <small>18 </small>And they 
tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for <i>the desire of</i> their 
souls. <small>19 </small>They spoke also against 
God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness?
<small>20 </small>Forasmuch as he smote the rock, 
and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to 
give bread, or prepare a table for his people? </p>
<p><small>21
</small>Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was 
kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel. <small>22 </small>Because they believed not in God, and 
trusted not in his salvation. <small>23 </small>
Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of 
heaven, <small>24 </small>and rained upon them 
manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven. <small>25 </small>Man ate angels’ bread; he sent them 
provision to the full. </p>
<p><small>26 </small>
He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the 
south-west wind. <small>27 </small>And he rained 
upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas. <small>28 </small>
And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents. <small>29
</small>So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them 
their desire. </p>
<p><small>30 </small>They were not disappointed of their desire: <i>but</i> when their food was yet 
in their mouth, <small>31 </small>then the 
indignation of God rose up against them, and slew the fattest of them, and 
overthrew the choice men of Israel. </p>
<p><small>32 </small>
In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not 
his miracles. <small>33 </small>
And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety.
</p>
<p><small>34 </small>When he slew them, they sought 
him: and they returned and called betimes upon God. <small>35 </small>And they remembered that God was their 
helper, and the most high God was their redeemer. <small>36
</small>Yet they loved him <i>only</i> with their mouth, 
and lied to him with their tongue. <small>37 </small>
For their heart <i>was</i> not right with him, neither 
were they steadfast in his covenant. </p>
<p><small>38 </small>
But he is compassionate, and will forgive their sins, and 
will not destroy <i>them</i>: yea, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and 
will not kindle all his anger. <small>39 </small>
And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not.</p>

<p><small>40 </small>How often did they provoke 
him in the wilderness, <i>and</i> anger him in a dry land! <small>41 </small>Yea, they turned back, and tempted God, 
and provoked the Holy One of Israel. <small>42
</small>They remembered not his hand, the day in which he 
delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. <small>43 </small>
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in 
the field of Tanes: <small>44 </small>and had 
changed their rivers into blood; and their streams, that they should not drink. <small>45 </small>
He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it 
spoiled them.
<small>46 </small>And he gave their fruit 
to the canker worm, and their labours to the locust. <small>47
</small>He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with 
frost. <small>48 </small>And he gave up their 
cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire. <small>49 </small>He sent out against them the fury of his 
anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels. <small>50 </small>
He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned 
their cattle to death; <small>51 </small>and smote every 
first-born in the land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labours in the tents 
of Cham. <small>52 </small>And he removed his 
people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness. <small>53 </small>And he guided them with hope, and they 
feared not: but the sea covered their enemies. <small>54
</small>And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, 
this mountain which his right hand had purchased. <small>55 </small>And he cast out the nations from before 
them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of 
Israel to dwell in their tents. </p>
<p><small>56 </small>
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his 
testimonies. <small>57 </small>And they turned 
back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked 
bow. <small>58 </small>And they provoked him with 
their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </p>
<p><small>59 </small>God heard 
and lightly regarded <i>them</i>, and greatly despised Israel. <small>60 </small>And he rejected the tabernacle 
of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men. <small>61 </small>
And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into 
the enemy’s hand. <small>62 </small>
And he gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance.
<small>63 </small>Fire devoured their young men; 
and their virgins mourned not. <small>64 </small>
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be 
wept for. </p>
<p><small>65 </small>So the 
Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <i>and</i> as a mighty man who has been heated 
with wine. <small>66 </small>And he smote his 
enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach. </p>
<p>
<small>67 </small>And he rejected the tabernacle of 
Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; <small>68 </small>
but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he 
loved. <small>69 </small>And he built his 
sanctuary as <i>the place</i> of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth.
<small>70 </small>He chose David also his servant, 
and took him up from the flocks of sheep. <small>71
</small>He took him from following the ewes great with young, to 
be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.
<small>72 </small>So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</p>

<h2>Psalm 79</h2>
<h4>A Psalm for Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>79:1 </small>O 
God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; they have polluted thy holy 
temple; they have made Jerusalem a storehouse of fruits. <small>2
</small>They have given the dead bodies of thy servants <i>
to be</i> food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of thy holy ones for the wild 
beasts of the earth. <small>3 </small>They 
have shed their blood as water, round about Jerusalem; and there was none to 
bury <i>them</i>. <small>4 </small>We are 
become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them <i>that are</i> 
round about us. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>How long, O Lord? 
wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
<small>6 </small>Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen 
that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms which have not called upon thy 
name. <small>7 </small>For they have devoured 
Jacob, and laid his place waste. </p>
<p><small>8 </small>
Remember not our old transgressions; let thy tender mercies 
speedily prevent us; for we are greatly impoverished. <small>9 </small>Help us, O God our Saviour; for 
the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us; and be merciful to our sins, for thy 
name’s sake. <small>10 </small>Lets haply they 
should say among the heathen, Where is their God? and let the avenging of thy 
servant’s blood that has been shed be known among the heathen before our eyes. </p>
<p><small>11 </small>Let the groaning of 
the prisoners come in before thee; according to the greatness of thine arm 
preserve the sons of the slain ones. <small>12 </small>
Repay to our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their 
reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O Lord. <small>13
</small>For we are thy people and the sheep of thy pasture; we 
will give thee thanks for ever; we will declare thy praise throughout all 
generations.</p>

<p><small>80:1 </small>Attend, O Shepherd of Israel, who guidest Joseph like a flock; thou 
who sittest upon the cherubs, manifest thyself; <small>2 </small>
before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasse, stir up thy 
power, and come to deliver us. <small>3 </small>
Turn us, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be delivered.
</p>
<p><small>4 </small>O Lord God of hosts, how long art 
thou angry with the prayer of thy servant? <small>5
</small>Thou wilt feed us with bread of tears; and wilt cause us 
to drink tears by measure. <small>6 </small>
Thou has made us a strife to our neighbours; and our 
enemies have mocked at us. <small>7 </small>Turn 
us, O Lord God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 
Pause.</p>

<p><small>8 </small>Thou hast transplanted a vine out of 
Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. <small>9 </small>Thou madest a way before it, and 
didst cause its roots to strike, and the land was filled <i>with it</i>. <small>10 </small>Its shadow covered the 
mountains, and its shoots <i>equalled</i> the goodly cedars. <small>11 </small>It sent forth its branches to the sea, 
and its shoots to the river. <small>12 </small>
Wherefore hast thou broken down its hedge, while all that pass by 
the way pluck it? <small>13 </small>The boar out of 
the wood has laid it waste, and the wild beast has devoured it.
<small>14 </small>O God of hosts, turn, we 
pray thee: look on <i>us</i> from heaven, and behold and visit this vine; <small>15 </small>and restore that which thy right hand 
has planted: and look on the son of man whom thou didst strengthen for thyself. <small>16 </small> <i>It is</i> 
burnt with fire and dug up: they shall perish at the rebuke of thy presence.
<small>17 </small>Let thy hand be upon the man of 
thy right hand, and upon the son of man whom thou didst strengthen for thyself. </p>
<p><small>18 </small>So will we not 
depart from thee: thou shalt quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. <small>19 </small>Turn us, O Lord God of hosts, and make 
thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>

<h2>Psalm 81</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm for Asaph, 
concerning the wine-presses.</h4>
<p><small>81:1 </small>Rejoice ye in God our helper; shout 
aloud to the God of Jacob. <small>2 </small>Take a 
psalm, and produce the timbrel, the pleasant psaltery with the harp. <small>3 </small>Blow the trumpet at the new moon, in the 
glorious day of your feast. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
For <i>this</i> is an ordinance for Israel, and a statute 
of the God of Jacob. <small>5 </small>He 
made it <i>to be</i> a testimony in Joseph, when he came forth out of the land 
of Egypt: he heard a language which he understood not. </p>
<p><small>6
</small>He removed his back from burdens: his hands slaved in 
making the baskets. <small>7 </small>Thou didst 
call upon me in trouble, and I delivered thee; I heard thee in the secret place 
of the storm: I proved thee at the water of Strife. Pause.
<small>8 </small>Hear, my people, and I will speak to 
thee, O Israel; and I will testify to thee: if thou wilt hearken to me;
<small>9 </small>there shall be no new god 
in thee; neither shalt thou worship a strange god. <small>10
</small>For I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the 
land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. <small>11 </small>But my people hearkened not to my voice; 
and Israel gave no heed to me. <small>12 </small>
So I let them go after the ways of their own hearts: they will go 
on in their own ways. </p>
<p><small>13 </small>
If my people had hearkened to me, if Israel had walked in my ways,
<small>14 </small>I should have put down their 
enemies very quickly, and should have laid my hand upon those that afflicted 
them. <small>15 </small>The 
Lord’s enemies <i>should have</i> lied to him: but their time shall be for ever.
<small>16 </small>And he fed them with the fat of 
wheat; and satisfied them with honey out of the rock.</p>

<h2>Psalm 82</h2>
<h4>A Psalm for Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>82:1 </small>God 
stands in the assembly of gods; and in the midst <i>of them</i> will judge gods.
<small>2 </small>How long will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the persons of sinners? Pause. <small>3
</small>Judge the orphan and poor: do justice to the low and 
needy. <small>4 </small>Rescue the needy, and 
deliver the poor out of the hand of the sinner. </p>
<p>
<small>5 </small>They know not, nor understand; they walk 
on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be shaken.<small> 6 </small>I have said, Ye are gods; and 
all <i>of you</i> children of the Most High. <small>7 </small>
But ye die as men, and fall as one of the princes. </p>
<p>
<small>8 </small>Arise, O God, judge the earth: for 
thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>
<h2>Psalm 83</h2>
<h4>A Song of a Psalm for Asaph.</h4>
<p><small>83:1 </small>O God, who shall be compared to 
thee? be not silent, neither be still, O God. </p>
<p><small>2 </small>For behold, thine 
enemies have made a noise; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
<small>3 </small>Against thy people they have 
craftily imagined a device, and have taken counsel against thy saints.
<small>4 </small>They have said, Come, and let us 
utterly destroy them out of the nation; and let the name of Israel be remembered 
no more at all. <small>5 </small>For they have 
taken counsel together with one consent: they have made a confederacy against 
thee; <small>6 </small>even the tents of the Idumeans, and the Ismaelites; Moab, and the Agarenes;
<small>7 </small>Gebal, and Ammon, and 
Amalec; the Philistines also, with them that dwell at Tyre. <small>8 </small>Yea, Assur too is come with them: 
they have become a help to the children of Lot. Pause.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>Do thou to them as to Madiam, 
and to Sisera; as to Jabin at the brook of Kison. <small>10
</small>They were utterly destroyed at Aendor: they became 
as dung for the earth. <small>11 </small>Make their princes as Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana; <i>even</i> all their 
princes: <small>12 </small>who said, let us take to 
ourselves the altar of God as an inheritance. <small>13
</small>O my God, make them as a wheel; as stubble before the face 
of the wind. <small>14 </small>As fire which shall 
burn up a wood, as the flame may consume the mountains; <small>15 </small>so shalt thou persecute them 
with thy tempest, and trouble them in thine anger. <small>16
</small>Fill their faces with dishonour; so shall they 
seek thy name, O Lord. <small>17 </small>Let them 
be ashamed and troubled for evermore; yea, let them be confounded and destroyed. <small>18 </small>
And let them know that thy name is Lord; that thou alone art Most High over all 
the earth.</p>
<h2>Psalm 84</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm for the sons 
of Core, concerning the wine-presses.</h4>
<p><small>84:1 </small>How amiable are thy tabernacles, O 
Lord of hosts! <small>2 </small>
My soul longs, and faints for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh have 
exulted in the living god. <small>3 </small>
Yea, the sparrow has found himself a home, and the 
turtle-dove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, <i>even</i> thine 
altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will praise thee 
evermore. Pause. <small>5 </small>Blessed is the 
man whose help is of thee, O Lord; in his heart he has purposed to go up <small>6 </small>the valley of 
weeping, to the place which he has appointed, for <i>there</i> the law-giver 
will grant blessings. <small>7 </small>They 
shall go from strength to strength: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.</p>

<p><small>8 </small>O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: 
hearken, O God of Jacob. Pause. <small>9 </small>
Behold, O God our defender, and look upon the face of thine anointed. <small>10 </small>
For one day in thy courts is better than thousands. I would rather be an abject 
in the house of God, than dwell in the tents of sinners. <small>11
</small>For the Lord loves mercy and truth: God will give grace 
and glory: the Lord will not withhold good things from them that walk in 
innocence. <small>12 </small>O Lord of hosts, 
blessed is the man that trusts in thee.</p>
<h2>Psalm 85</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm for the sons 
of Core.</h4>
<p><small>85:1 </small>O Lord, thou has taken pleasure in 
thy land: thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob. <small>2 </small>
Thou hast forgiven thy people their transgressions; thou has 
covered all their sins. Pause. <small>3 </small>
Thou has caused all thy wrath to cease: thou hast turned from thy 
fierce anger. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>Turn us, O God of 
our salvation, and turn thy anger away from us. <small>5 </small>Wouldest thou be angry with us for 
ever? or wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation? <small>6 </small>O God, thou wilt turn and quicken us; and 
thy people shall rejoice in thee. <small>7 </small>
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.</p>

<p><small>8 </small>I will hear what the Lord God will say 
concerning me: for he shall speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to 
those that turn their heart toward him. <small>9
</small>Moreover his salvation is near them that fear him; that 
glory may dwell in our land. <small>10 </small>
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace 
have kissed <i>each other</i>. <small>11 </small>
Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from 
heaven. <small>12 </small>For the Lord will give 
goodness; and our land shall yield her fruit. <small>13
</small>Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set his steps 
in the way.</p>

<h2>Psalm 86</h2>
<h4>A Prayer of David.</h4>
<p><small>86:1 </small>O 
Lord, incline thine ear, and hearken to me; for I am poor and needy. <small>2 </small>Preserve my soul, for I am holy; save thy 
servant, O God, who hopes in thee. <small>3 </small>
Pity me, O Lord: for to thee will I cry all the day.
<small>4 </small>Rejoice the sold of thy servant: 
for to thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul. <small>5
</small>For thou, O Lord, art kind, and gentle; and plenteous in 
mercy to all that call upon thee. <small>6 </small>
Give ear to my prayer, o Lord; and attend to the voice of my 
supplication. <small>7 </small>In the day of my 
trouble I cried to thee: for thou didst hear me.</p>

<p><small>8 </small>There is none like to thee, O 
Lord, among the god; and there are no <i>works</i> like to thy works. <small>9 </small>All nations whom thou hast made shall 
come, and shall worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
<small>10 </small>For thou art great, and 
doest wonders: thou art the only <i>and</i> the great God. <small>11 </small>Guide me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will 
walk in thy truth: let my heart rejoice, that I may fear thy name.
<small>12 </small>I will give thee thanks, O Lord 
my God, with all my heart; and I will glorify thy name for ever. <small>13 </small>For thy mercy is great toward me; and 
thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. </p>
<p><small>
14 </small>O God, transgressors have risen up against me, 
and an assembly of violent <i>men</i> have sought my life; and have not set thee 
before them. <small>15 </small>But thou, O Lord 
God, art compassionate and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy and 
true. <small>16</small> Look thou upon 
me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son 
of thine handmaid. <small>17 </small>Establish with me a token for good; and let them that hate me see <i>it</i> and 
be ashamed; because thou, O Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me.</p>
<h2>Psalm 87</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of a Song for the sons of 
Core.</h4>
<p><small>87:1 </small>His foundations are in the holy 
mountains. <small>2 </small>The Lord loves the gates of Sion, 
more than all the tabernacles of Jacob. <small>3 </small>
Glorious things have been spoken of thee, O city of God. Pause.</p>

<p><small>4 </small>I will make mention of Raab 
and Babylon to them that know me: behold also the Philistines, and Tyre, and the 
people of the Ethiopians: these were born there. <small>5 </small>
A man shall say, Sion <i>is my</i> mother; and <i>such</i> 
a man was born in her; and the Highest himself has founded her. <small>6 </small>The Lord shall recount <i>it</i> 
in the writing of the people, and of these princes that were born in her. <small>7 </small>The dwelling of all within thee is
<i>as the dwelling</i> of those that rejoice.</p>

<h2>Psalm 88</h2>
<h4>A song of a Psalm for 
the sons of Core for the end, upon Maeleth for responsive <i>strains</i>, of 
instruction for Æman the Israelite.</h4>
<p><small>88:1 </small>O Lord God of my salvation, I have 
cried by day and in the night before thee. <small>2 </small>
Let my prayer come in before thee; incline thine ear to my 
supplication, O Lord. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>For my soul 
is filled with troubles, and my life has drawn nigh to Hades. <small>4 </small>I have been reckoned with them that go 
down to the pit; I became as a man without help; <small>5
</small>free among the dead, as the slain ones cast out, 
who sleep in the tomb; whom thou rememberest no more; and they are rejected from 
thy hand. <small>6 </small>They laid me in 
the lowest pit, in dark <i>places</i>, and in the shadow of death. <small>7 </small>Thy wrath has pressed heavily upon me, 
and thou hast brought upon me all thy billows. Pause. <small>
8 </small>Thou hast removed my acquaintance far from me; they have 
made me an abomination to themselves; I have been delivered up, and have not 
gone forth. <small>9 </small>Mine eyes are dimmed 
from poverty; but I cried to thee, O Lord, all the day; I spread forth my hands 
to thee.</p>

<p><small>10 </small>Wilt thou work wonders for 
the dead? or shall physicians raise <i>them</i> up, that they shall praise thee?
<small>11 </small>Shall any one declare thy mercy 
in the tomb? and thy truth in destruction? <small>12 </small>
Shall thy wonders be known in darkness? and thy righteousness in 
a forgotten land? <small>13 </small>
But I cried to thee, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer 
prevent thee. </p>
<p><small>14 </small>Wherefore, O Lord, dost thou reject my prayer, <i>and</i> turn thy face away 
from me? <small>15 </small>I am poor and in 
troubles from my youth; and having been exalted, I was brought low and into 
despair. <small>16 </small>Thy wrath has passed 
over me; and thy terrors have greatly disquieted me. <small>17 </small>They compassed me like water; all the 
day they beset me together. <small>18 </small>
Thou hast put far from me <i>every</i> friend, and mine 
acquaintances because of <i>my</i> wretchedness.</p>

<h2>Psalm 89</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of 
instruction for Ætham the Israelite.</h4>
<p><small>89:1 </small>I will sing of thy mercies, O Lord, 
for ever: I will declare thy truth with my mouth to all generations. <small>2 </small>For thou hast said, Mercy shall be built 
up for ever: thy truth shall be established in the heavens. <small>3 </small>I made a covenant with my chosen 
ones, I sware unto David my servant. <small>4 </small>
I will establish thy seed for ever, and build up thy throne to 
all generations. Pause.</p>

<p><small>5 </small>The heavens shall declare thy wonders, 
O Lord; and thy truth in the assembly of the saints. <small>6 </small>For who in the heavens shall be compared 
to the Lord? and who shall be likened to the Lord among the sons of God? <small>7 </small>
God is glorified in the council of the saints; great and terrible toward all 
that are round about him. <small>8 </small>O Lord 
God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is 
round about thee.
<small>9 </small>Thou rulest the power of 
the sea; and thou calmest the tumult of its waves. <small>10
</small>Thou has brought down the proud as one that is 
slain; and with the arm of thy power thou has scattered thine enemies. <small>11 </small>The heavens are thine, and the 
earth is thine: thou hast founded the world, and the fullness of it. <small>12 </small>Thou hast created the north and 
the west: Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. <small>13
</small>Thine is the mighty arm: let thy hand be 
strengthened, let thy right hand be exalted. <small>14 </small>
Justice and judgment are the establishment of thy throne: mercy 
and truth shall go before thy face.</p>

<p><small>15 </small>Blessed is the people that knows the 
joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance. <small>16 </small>
And in thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall 
they be exalted. <small>17 </small>For thou art the 
boast of their strength; and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted,
<small>18 </small>for <i>our</i> help is of 
the Lord; and of the Holy One of Israel, our king.</p>

<p><small>19 </small>Then thou spokest in vision 
to thy children, and saidst, I have laid help on a mighty one; I have exalted 
one chosen out of my people. <small>20 </small>
I have found David my servant; I have anointed him by <i>my</i> holy 
mercy. <small>21 </small>For my hand shall support 
him; and mine arm shall strengthen him. <small>22 </small>
The enemy shall have no advantage against him; and the son of 
transgression shall not hurt him again. <small>23 </small>
And I will hew down his foes before him, and put to flight those 
that hate him. <small>24 </small>
But my truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be 
exalted. <small>25 </small>And I will set his hand 
in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. <small>26 </small>He shall call upon me, <i>saying</i>, 
Thou art my Father, my God, and the helper of my salvation. <small>27 </small>And I will make him <i>my</i> 
first-born, higher than the kings of the earth. <small>28 </small>
I will keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant <i>
shall be</i> firm with him. <small>29 </small>
And I will establish his seed for ever and ever, and his throne as the days of 
heaven. </p>
<p><small>30 </small>If his children should 
forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; <small>31 </small>if they should profane my ordinances, 
and not keep my commandments; <small>32 </small>
I will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their sins with 
scourges. <small>33 </small>But my mercy I will not 
utterly remove from him, nor wrong my truth. <small>34 </small>Neither will I by any means profane my 
covenant; and I will not make void the things that proceed out of my lips. <small>35 </small>
Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie to David. <small>36 </small>
His see shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before 
me; <small>37 </small>and as the 
moon <i>that is</i> established for ever, and as the faithful witness in heaven. 
Pause.</p>

<p><small>38 </small>But thou hast cast off and 
set at nought, thou has rejected thine anointed. <small>39 </small>
Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant; thou 
has profaned his sanctuary, <i>casting it</i> to the ground. <small>40 </small>Thou hast broken down all his hedges; 
thou hast made his strong holds a terror. <small>41
</small>All that go by the way have spoiled him: he is 
become a reproach to his neighbours. <small>42 </small>
Thou hast exalted the right hand of his enemies; thou hast made 
all his enemies to rejoice. <small>43 </small>
Thou hast turned back the help of his sword, and hast not helped 
him in the battle. <small>44 </small>Thou hast 
deprived him of glory: thou hast broken down his throne to the ground.
<small>45 </small>Thou hast shortened the days of 
his throne: thou hast poured shame upon him. Pause. </p>
<p>
<small>46 </small>How long, O Lord, wilt thou turn 
away, for ever? shall thine anger flame out as fire? <small>47
</small>Remember what my being is: for hast thou created all the 
sons of men in vain? <small>48 </small>
What man is there who shall live, and not see death? shall <i>any one</i> 
deliver his soul from the hand of Hades? Pause. <small>49 </small>
Where are thine ancient mercies, O Lord, which thou 
swarest to David in thy truth? <small>50 </small>
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of thy servants, which I have borne in my 
bosom, <i>even the reproach</i> of many nations; <small>51 </small>
wherewith thine enemies have reviled, O Lord: wherewith 
they have reviled the recompense of thine anointed. <small>52
</small>Blessed be the Lord for ever. So be it, so be it.</p>
<h2>Psalm 90</h2>
<h4>A Prayer of Moses the man of God.</h4>
<p><small>90:1 </small>Lord, thou hast been our refuge in 
all generations. <small>2 </small>Before the mountains existed, and
<i>before</i> the earth and the world were formed, even from age to age, Thou 
art. <small>3 </small>Turn not man back to
<i>his</i> low place, whereas thou saidst, Return, ye sons of men? <small>4 </small>For a thousand years in thy sight are as 
the yesterday which is past, and as a watch in the night. <small>5 </small>Years shall be vanity to them: let the 
morning pass away as grass. <small>6 </small>
In the morning let it flower, and pass away: in the evening let it droop, let it 
be withered and dried up.
<small>7 </small>For we have perished in thine anger, 
and in thy wrath we have been troubled. <small>8 </small>
Thou hast set our transgressions before thee: our age is in the 
light of thy countenance. <small>9 </small>
For all our days are gone, and we have passed away in thy wrath: our years have 
spun out their tale as a spider. <small>10 </small>
 <i>As for</i> the days of our years, in them are seventy 
years; and if <i>men should be</i> in strength, eighty years: and the greater 
part of them would be labour and trouble; for weakness overtakes us, and we 
shall be chastened. <small>11 </small>Who knows the 
power of thy wrath?
<small>12 </small>and <i>who knows how</i> to 
number <i>his days</i> because of the fear of thy wrath? So manifest thy right 
hand, and those that are instructed in wisdom in the heart. </p>
<p>
<small>13 </small>Return, O Lord, how long? and be 
intreated concerning thy servants. <small>14 </small>
We have been satisfied in the morning with thy mercy; and we did 
exult and rejoice: <small>15 </small>let us rejoice 
in all our days, in return for the days wherein thou didst afflict us, the years 
wherein we saw evil. <small>16 </small>
And look upon thy servants, and upon thy works; and guide their 
children. <small>17 </small>And let the brightness 
of the Lord our God be upon us: and do thou direct for us the works of our 
hands.</p>

<h2>Psalm 91</h2>
<h4>Praise of a Song, by David.</h4>
<p><small>91:1 </small>He that dwells in the help of the 
Highest, shall sojourn under the shelter of the God of heaven. <small>2 </small>
He shall say to the Lord, Thou art my helper and my refuge: my God; I will hope 
in him. <small>3 </small>For he 
shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters, from <i>every</i> troublesome 
matter. <small>4 </small>He shall overshadow 
thee with his shoulders, and thou shalt trust under his wings: his truth shall 
cover thee with a shield. <small>5 </small>Thou shalt not be afraid of terror by night; nor of the arrow flying by day;
<small>6 </small> <i>nor</i> of the <i>evil</i> 
thing that walks in darkness; <i>nor</i> of calamity, and the evil spirit at 
noon-day. <small>7 </small>A thousand shall fall at 
thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. <small>8 </small>Only with thine eyes 
shalt thou observe and see the reward of sinners.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>For thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou, 
my soul, hast made the Most High thy refuge. <small>
10 </small>No evils shall come upon thee, and no scourge shall 
draw night to thy dwelling. <small>11 </small>
For he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee 
in all thy ways. <small>12 </small>
They shall bear thee up on their hands, lest at any time thou dash thy foot 
against a stone. <small>13 </small>Thou shalt tread on the asp and basilisk: and thou shalt trample on the lion and 
dragon. </p>
<p><small>14 </small>For he has hoped in me, 
and I will deliver him: I will protect him, because he has known my name.
<small>15 </small>He shall call upon me, and I will 
hearken to him: I am with him in affliction; and I will deliver him, and glorify 
him. <small>16 </small>I will 
satisfy him with length of days, and shew him my salvation.</p>

<h2>Psalm 92</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of a Song for the 
Sabbath-day.</h4>
<p><small>92:1 </small>It is a good thing to give thanks 
to the Lord, and to sing praises to thy name, O thou Most High; <small>2 </small>
to proclaim thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth by night, <small>3 </small>
on a psaltery of ten strings, with a song on the harp. <small>4 </small>
For thou, O Lord, hast made me glad with thy work: and in the operations of thy 
hands will I exult. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>How have thy 
works been magnified, O Lord! thy thoughts are very deep. <small>6 </small>A foolish man will not know, and a 
senseless man will not understand this.
<small>7 </small>When the sinners spring up as 
the grass, and all the workers of iniquity have watched; <i>it is</i> that they 
may be utterly destroyed for ever. <small>8 </small>
But thou, O Lord, art most high for ever. </p>
<p>
<small>9 </small>For, behold, thine enemies shall 
perish; and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. <small>10 </small> But my horn shall be exalted <i>
as the horn</i> of a unicorn; and mine old age with rich mercy. <small>11 </small>And mine eye has seen mine enemies, and 
mine ear shall hear the wicked that rise up against me. </p>
<p>
<small>12 </small>The righteous shall flourish as 
a palm-tree: he shall be increased as the cedar in Libanus. <small>13 </small>They that are planted in the house of 
the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God. <small>14 </small>Then shall they be increased in a fine 
old age; and they shall be prosperous; that they may declare <small>15 </small>that the Lord my God is righteous, and 
there is no iniquity in him.</p>

<h2>Psalm 93</h2>
<h4>For the day before the 
Sabbath, when the land was <i>first</i> inhabited, the praise of a Song by 
David.</h4>
<p><small>93:1 </small>The Lord reigns; he has clothed himself with honour: the Lord has 
clothed and girded himself with strength; for he has established the world, 
which shall not be moved. <small>2 </small>Thy 
throne is prepared of old: thou art from everlasting. <small>
3 </small>The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have 
lifted up their voices, <small>4 </small>
at the voices of many waters: the billows of the sea are wonderful: the Lord is 
wonderful in high places. <small>5 </small>
Thy testimonies are made very sure: holiness becomes thine house, O Lord, 
for ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 94</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David for the 
fourth <i>day</i> of the week.</h4>
<p><small>94:1 </small>The Lord is a God of vengeance; the 
God of vengeance has declared himself. <small>2 </small>
Be thou exalted, thou that judgest the earth: render a reward to the 
proud. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>How long shall sinners, O 
Lord, how long shall sinners boast? <small>4 </small>
They will utter and speak unrighteousness; all the workers 
of iniquity will speak <i>so</i>. <small>5 </small>
They have afflicted thy people, O Lord, and hurt thine heritage. <small>6 </small>They have slain the widow and fatherless, 
and murdered the stranger. <small>7 </small>
And they said, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of 
Jacob understand. </p>
<p><small>8 </small>Understand now, 
ye simple among the people; and ye fools, at length be wise.
<small>9 </small>He that planted the ear, does he 
not hear? or he that formed the eye, does not he perceive? <small>10 </small>He that chastises the heathen, 
shall not he punish, <i>even</i> he that teaches man knowledge? <small>11 </small>The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that 
they are vain.</p>

<p><small>12 </small>Blessed is the man 
whomsoever thou shalt chasten, O Lord, and shalt teach him out of thy law;
<small>13 </small>to give him rest from 
evil days, until a pit be digged for the sinful one. <small>14
</small>For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he 
forsake his inheritance; <small>15 </small>
until righteousness return to judgment, and all the upright in heart shall 
follow it. Pause. </p>
<p><small>16 </small>Who will rise 
up for me against the transgressors? or who will stand up with me against the 
workers of iniquity? <small>17 </small>
If the Lord had not helped me, my soul had almost sojourned in Hades.
<small>18 </small>If I said, My foot has been 
moved; <small>19 </small>thy mercy, O 
Lord, helped me. O Lord, according to the multitude of my griefs within my 
heart, thy consolation have soothed my soul. </p>
<p><small>20 </small>
Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which 
frames mischief by an ordinance? <small>21 </small>
They will hunt for the soul of the righteous, and condemn 
innocent blood. <small>22</small> But the Lord was 
my refuge; and my God the helper of my hope. <small>23
</small>And he will recompense to them their iniquity and their 
wickedness: the Lord our God shall utterly destroy them.</p>

<h2>Psalm 95</h2>
<h4>The praise of a Song by David.</h4>
<p><small>95:1 </small>Come, let us exult in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to God our Saviour. <small>2 </small>
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise to 
him with psalms.
<small>3 </small>For the Lord is a great God, and a 
great king over all gods: for the Lord will not cast off his people.
<small>4 </small>For the ends of the earth are in 
his hands; and the heights of the mountains are his. <small>5 </small>For the sea is his, and he made it: and 
is hands formed the dry land. </p>
<p><small>6 </small>
Come, let us worship and fall down before him; and weep before 
the Lord that made us.
<small>7 </small>For he is our God; and we are the 
people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. <small>8
</small>To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, 
as in the provocation, according to the day of irritation in the wilderness: <small>9 </small>
where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works. <small>10 </small>
Forty years was I grieved with this generation, and said, They do 
always err in their heart, and they have not known my ways. <small>11 </small>So I sware in my wrath, They 
shall not enter into my rest.</p>

<h2>Psalm 96</h2>
<h4>When the house was built after the 
Captivity, a Song of David.</h4>
<p><small>96:1 </small>Sing to the Lord a new song; sing 
to the Lord, all the earth. <small>2 </small>Sing 
to the Lord, bless his name: proclaim his salvation from day to day. <small>3 </small>Publish his glory among the Gentiles, his 
wonderful works among all people. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is terrible 
above all gods. <small>5 </small>For all the gods 
of the heathen are devils: but the Lord made the heavens.
<small>6 </small>Thanksgiving and beauty are before 
him: holiness and majesty are in his sanctuary. </p>
<p><small>7
</small>Bring to the Lord, ye families of the Gentiles, 
bring to the Lord glory and honour. <small>8 </small>
Bring to the Lord the glory <i>becoming</i> his name: take 
offerings, and go into his courts. <small>9 </small>
Worship the Lord in his holy court: let all the earth tremble 
before him.
<small>10 </small>Say among the heathen, The Lord 
reigns: for he has established the world so that it shall not be moved: he shall 
judge the people in righteousness. <small>11 </small>
Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult; let the sea be 
moved, and the fullness of it. <small>12 </small>
The plains shall rejoice, and all things in them: then shall all 
the trees of the wood exult before the presence of the Lord: <small>13 </small>for he comes, for he comes to judge the 
earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness, and the people with his truth.</p>

<h2>Psalm 97</h2>
<h4>For David, when his land is 
established.</h4>
<p><small>97:1 </small>The Lord reigns, let the earth 
exult, let many islands rejoice. </p>
<p><small>2 </small>
Cloud, and darkness are round about him; righteousness and judgment are the 
establishment of his throne. <small>3 </small>Fire 
shall go before him, and burn up his enemies round about. <small>4
</small>His lightnings appeared to the world; the earth 
saw, and trembled. <small>5 </small>The mountains 
melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the 
whole earth. <small>6 </small>The heavens have 
declared his righteousness, and all the people have seen his glory. </p>
<p><small>7 </small>
Let all that worship graven images be ashamed, who boast of their idols; worship 
him, all ye his angels.</p>

<p><small>8 </small>Sion heard and rejoiced; and 
the daughters of Judea exulted, because of thy judgments, O Lord. <small>9 </small>For thou art Lord most high over all the 
earth; thou art greatly exalted above all gods. </p>
<p><small>10
</small>Ye that love the Lord, hate evil; the Lord preserves the 
souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of sinners. <small>11 </small>
Light is sprung up for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. <small>12 </small>Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; and 
give thanks for a remembrance of his holiness.</p>

<h2>Psalm 98</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>98:1 </small>Sing to the Lord a new song; for 
the Lord has wrought wonderful works, his right hand, and his holy arm, have 
wrought salvation for him. </p>
<p><small>2
</small>The Lord has made known his salvation, he has revealed his 
righteousness in the sight of the nations. <small>3
</small>He has remembered his mercy to Jacob, and his truth to the 
house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>

<p><small>4 </small>Shout to God, all the earth; sing, and 
exult, and sing psalms. <small>5 </small>
Sing to the Lord with a harp, with a harp, and the voice of a psalm.
<small>6 </small>With trumpets of metal, and the 
sound of a trumpet of horn make a joyful noise to the Lord before the king.
<small>7 </small>Let the sea be moved, and the 
fullness of it; the world, and they that dwell in it. <small>
8 </small>The rivers shall clap their hands together; the 
mountains shall exult. <small>9 </small>For he is 
come to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness, and the 
nations in uprightness.</p>

<h2>Psalm 99</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>99:1 </small>The 
Lord reigns; —let the people rage; <i>it is he</i> that sits upon the cherubs, 
let the earth be moved. <small>2 </small>The 
Lord is great in Sion, and is high over all the people. <small>3
</small>Let them give thanks to thy great name; for it is terrible 
and holy. <small>4 </small>And the 
king’s honour loves judgment; thou hast prepared equity, thou hast wrought 
judgment and justice in Jacob. <small>5 </small>
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship <i>at</i> his footstool; for he is 
holy.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>Moses and Aaron among his priests, and 
Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he 
heard them. <small>7 </small>He spoke to them in a 
pillar of cloud; they kept his testimonies, and the ordinances which he gave 
them. <small>8 </small>
O Lord our God, thou heardest them; O God, thou becamest propitious to 
them, though thou didst take vengeance on all their devices. <small>9 </small>Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at 
his holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy.</p>
<h2>Psalm 100</h2>
<h4>A Psalm for Thanksgiving.</h4>
<p><small>100:1 </small>Make a joyful noise to the Lord, 
all the earth. <small>2 </small>Serve the Lord with gladness; come before 
his presence with exultation. <small>3 </small>
Know that the Lord he is God; he made us, and not we 
ourselves; <i>we are</i> his people, and the sheep of his pasture. <small>4 </small>Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, 
and his courts with hymns; give thanks to him, praise his name.
<small>5 </small>For the Lord is good, his 
mercy is for ever; and his truth <i>endures</i> to generation and generation.</p>

<h2>Psalm 101</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>101:1 </small>I will sing to thee, O Lord, of 
mercy and judgment; I will sing a psalm, <small>2 </small>and I will be wise in a blameless way. 
When wilt thou come to me? I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst 
of my house. <small>3 </small>I have not set before 
mine eyes any unlawful ting; I have hated transgressors. <small>4 </small>A perverse heart has not cleaved to me; I 
have not known an evil man, forasmuch as he turns away from me. <small>5 </small>Him that privily speaks against 
his neighbour, him have I driven from <i>me</i>: he that is proud in look and 
insatiable in heart, —with him I have not eaten. <small>6 </small>
Mine eyes <i>shall be</i> upon the faithful of the land, 
that they may dwell with me: he that walked in a perfect way, the same 
ministered to me. <small>7 </small>The proud doer 
dwelt not in the midst of my house; the unjust speaker prospered not in my 
sight. <small>8 </small>Early did I slay all the 
sinners of the land, that I might destroy out of the city of the Lord all that 
work iniquity.</p>

<h2>Psalm 102</h2>
<h4>A Prayer for the Poor; when he is 
deeply afflicted, and pours out his supplication before the Lord.</h4>
<p><small>102:1 </small>Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my 
cry come to thee. <small>2
</small>Turn not away thy face from me: in the day <i>when</i> 
I am afflicted, incline thine ear to me: in the day <i>when</i> I shall call 
upon thee, speedily hear me. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>
For my days have vanished like smoke, and my bones have been parched like a 
stick. <small>4 </small>I am blighted like grass, 
and my heart is dried up; for I have forgotten to eat my bread. <small>5 </small>
By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bone has cleaved to my flesh. <small>6
</small>I have become like a pelican of the wilderness;
<small>7 </small>I have become like an owl in a 
ruined house. I have watched, and am become as a sparrow dwelling alone on a 
roof. <small>8 </small>All the day long mine 
enemies have reproached me; and they that praised me have sworn against me.
<small>9 </small>For I have eaten ashes as it were 
bread, and mingled my drink with weeping; <small>10
</small>because of thine anger and thy wrath: for thou 
hast lifted me up, and dashed me down. </p>
<p><small>11 </small>
My days have declined like a shadow; and I am withered like 
grass.
<small>12 </small>But thou, Lord, endurest 
for ever, and thy memorial to generation and generation. <small>
13 </small>Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: 
for <i>it is</i> time to have mercy upon her, for the set time is come. <small>14 </small>For thy servants have taken pleasure in 
her stones, and they shall pity her dust. <small>15
</small>So the nations shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all kings 
thy glory. </p>
<p><small>16 </small>For 
the Lord shall build up Sion, and shall appear in his glory. <small>17 </small>He has had regard to the prayer of the 
lowly, and has not despised their petition. <small>18
</small>Let this be written for another generation; and the people 
that shall be created shall praise the Lord. <small>19
</small>For he has looked out from the height of his sanctuary; 
the Lord looked upon the earth from heaven; <small>20
</small>to hear the groaning of the fettered ones, to loosen the 
sons of the slain; <small>21 </small>
to proclaim the name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
<small>22 </small>when the people are gathered 
together, and the kings, to serve the Lord.</p>

<p><small>23 </small>He answered him in the way of his 
strength: tell me the fewness of my days. <small>24</small> Take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years <i>
are</i> through all generations. <small>25 </small>
In the beginning thou, O Lord, didst lay the foundation of the earth; 
and the heavens are the works of thine hands. <small>26 </small>
They shall perish, but thou remainest: and <i>they all</i> 
shall wax old as a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold them, and they 
shall be changed. <small>27 </small>But thou art 
the same, and thy years shall not fail. <small>28 </small>
The children of thy servants shall dwell <i>securely</i>, 
and their seed shall prosper for ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 103</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</h4>
<p><small>103:1 </small>Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all <i>that is</i> within me, <i>bless</i> 
his holy name. <small>2 </small>Bless the Lord, O 
my soul, and forget not all his praises: <small>3 </small>
who forgives all thy transgressions, who heals all thy diseases; <small>4 </small>
who redeems thy life from corruption; who crowns thee with mercy and compassion; <small>5 </small>who satisfies thy desire with 
good things: <i>so that</i> thy youth shall be renewed like <i>that</i> of the 
eagle.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>The Lord executes mercy and judgment 
for all that are injured. <small>7 </small>
He made known his ways to Moses, his will to the children of 
Israel. <small>8 </small>The Lord is compassionate 
and pitiful, long-suffering, and full of mercy. <small>9 </small>He will not be always angry; neither will 
he be wrathful for ever. <small>10 </small>
He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor recompensed 
us according to our iniquities. <small>11 </small>
For as the heaven is high above the earth, the Lord has
<i>so</i> increased his mercy toward them that fear him. <small>
12 </small>As far as the east is from the west, <i>so far</i> 
has he removed our transgressions from us. <small>13 </small>
As a father pities <i>his</i> children, the Lord pities 
them that fear him. <small>14 </small>For he knows 
our frame: remember that we are dust. </p>
<p><small>15 </small>
 <i>As for</i> man, his days are as grass; as a flower of 
the field, so shall he flourish. <small>16 </small>
For the wind passes over it, and it shall not be; and it shall know its place no 
more. <small>17 </small>But the mercy of the Lord 
is from generation to generation upon them that fear him, and his righteousness 
to children’s children; <small>18 </small>
to them that keep his covenant, and remember his commandments to 
do them.
</p>
<p><small>19 </small>The Lord has prepared his throne in 
the heaven; and his kingdom rules over all. <small>20
</small>Bless the Lord, all ye his angels, mighty in 
strength, who perform his bidding, <i>ready</i> to hearken to the voice of his 
words. <small>21 </small>Bless the Lord, 
all ye his hosts; <i>ye</i> ministers of his that do his will. <small>22 </small>Bless the Lord, all his works, in every 
place of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul.</p>

<h2>Psalm 104</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</h4>
<p><small>104:1 </small>Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou 
hast clothed thyself with praise and honour: <small>2 </small>
who dost robe thyself with light as with a garment; spreading out 
the heaven as a curtain. <small>3 </small>
Who covers his chambers with waters; who makes the clouds his 
chariot; who walks on the wings of the wind. <small>4 </small>
Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flaming fire. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>
Who establishes the earth on her sure foundation: it shall not be moved for 
ever. <small>6 </small>The deep, as it were a garment, is his 
covering: the waters shall stand on the hills. <small>7
</small>At thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of thy thunder 
they shall be alarmed. <small>8 </small>
They go up to the mountains, and down to the plains, to the place which thou 
hast founded for them. <small>9 </small>
Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass, neither shall they turn again 
to cover the earth.</p>

<p><small>10 </small>He sends forth his fountains among 
the valleys: the waters shall run between the mountains. <small>11 </small>They shall give drink to all 
the wild beasts of the field: the wild asses shall take <i>of them</i> to <i>
quench</i> their thirst. <small>12 </small>By them 
shall the birds of the sky lodge: they shall utter a voice out of the midst of 
the rocks. <small>13 </small>He waters the 
mountains from his chambers: the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of thy 
works. </p>
<p><small>14 </small>He makes grass to grow for 
the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, to bring bread out of the 
earth; <small>15 </small>
and wine makes glad the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil: and 
bread strengthens man’s heart. <small>16 </small>
The trees of the plain shall be full <i>of sap</i>; <i>
even</i> the cedars of Libanus which he has planted. <small>17
</small>There the sparrows will build their nests; and the house 
of the heron takes the lead among them. <small>18
</small>The high mountains are a refuge for the stags, <i>
and</i> the rock for the rabbits.</p>

<p><small>19 </small>He appointed the moon for seasons: 
the sun knows his going down. <small>20 </small>
Thou didst make darkness, and it was night; in it all the wild 
beasts of the forest will be abroad: <small>21 </small>
 <i>even</i> young lions roaring for prey, and to seek 
meat for themselves from God. <small>22 </small>
The sun arises, and they shall be gathered together, and shall lie down in their 
dens. <small>23 </small>Man shall 
go forth to his work, and to his labour till evening. </p>
<p><small>24
</small>How great are thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast thou 
wrought them all: the earth is filled with thy creation. <small>25 </small> <i>So is</i> this great and 
wide sea: there are things creeping innumerable, small animals and great. <small>26 </small>There go the ships; <i>and</i> 
this dragon whom thou hast made to play in it. <small>27 </small>
All wait upon thee, to give them <i>their</i> food in 
due season. <small>28 </small>When thou 
hast given <i>it</i> them, they will gather <i>it</i>; and when thou hast opened 
thine hand, they shall all be filled with good. <small>29 </small>
But when thou hast turned away thy face, they shall be troubled: 
thou wilt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. <small>30 </small>Thou shalt 
send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and thou shalt renew the face 
of the earth.</p>

<p><small>31 </small>Let the glory of the Lord be for 
ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works; <small>32
</small>who looks upon the earth, and makes it tremble; who 
touches the mountains, and they smoke. <small>33 </small>
I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will sing praise to my 
God while I exist. <small>34 </small>Let my 
meditation be sweet to him: and I will rejoice in the Lord. <small>35 </small>Let the sinners fail from off the earth, 
and transgressors, so that they shall be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul.</p>

<h2>Psalm 105</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>105:1 </small>Give thanks to the Lord, and call 
upon his name; declare his works among the heathen.
<small>2 </small>Sing to him, yea, sing praises to 
him: tell forth all his wonderful works. <small>3
</small>Glory in his holy name: let the heart of them that seek 
the Lord rejoice. <small>4 </small>Seek ye the 
Lord, and be strengthened; seek his face continually. <small>5 </small>Remember his wonderful works that he has 
done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; <small>
6 </small> <i>ye</i> seed of Abraam, his servants, <i>ye</i> 
children of Jacob, his chosen ones. </p>
<p><small>7 </small>
He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.<small> 8 </small>He has remembered his covenant for 
ever, the word which he commanded for a thousand generation: <small>9 </small>which he established as a 
covenant to Abraam, and <i>he remembered</i> his oath to Isaac. <small>10 </small>And he established it to Jacob for an 
ordinance, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant; <small>11 </small>saying To thee will I give the 
land of Chanaan, the line of your inheritance: <small>12 </small>
when they were few in number, very few, and sojourners in it. <small>13 </small>And they went 
from nation to nation, and from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people. <small>14 </small>He suffered no man to wrong them; and he 
rebuked kings for their sakes: <small>15 </small>
 <i>saying</i>, Touch not my anointed ones; and do my 
prophets no harm. <small>16 </small>Moreover he 
called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole support of bread. </p>
<p><small>17 </small>
He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a slave. <small>18 </small>
They hurt his feet with fetters; his soul passed into iron, <small>19 </small>
until the time that his cause came on; the word of the Lord tried him as fire. <small>20 </small>The king sent and loosed him;
<i>even</i> the prince of the people, and let him go free. <small>21 </small>He made him Lord over his house, and 
ruler of all his substance; <small>22 </small>
to chastise his rulers at his pleasure, and to teach his elders 
wisdom. </p>
<p><small>23 </small>Israel 
also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Cham. <small>24 </small>And he increased his people greatly, and 
made them stronger than their enemies.
<small>25 </small>And he turned their heart to hate his 
people, to deal craftily with his servants. <small>26
</small>He sent fort Moses his servant, <i>and</i> Aaron 
whom he had chosen. </p>
<p><small>27 </small>He 
established among them his signs, and <i>his</i> wonders in the land of Cham.
<small>28 </small>He sent forth darkness, and made 
it dark; yet they rebelled against his words. <small>29
</small>He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. <small>30 </small>
Their land produced frogs abundantly, in the chambers of their kings. <small>31 </small>He spoke, and the dog-fly came, and lice 
in all their coasts. <small>32 </small>
He turned their rain into hail, <i>and sent</i> flaming fire in their 
land. <small>33 </small>And he smote their vines 
and their fig trees; and broke every tree of their coast. <small>34 </small>He spoke, and the locust came, and 
caterpillars innumerable, <small>35</small>
and devoured all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of the ground. <small>36 </small>He smote also 
every first-born of their land, the first-fruits of all their labour. <small>37 </small>And he brought them out with silver and 
gold; and there was not a feeble one among their tribes. <small>38 </small>Egypt rejoiced at their departing; for 
the fear of them fell upon them. <small>39 </small>
He spread out a cloud for a covering to them, and fire to give 
them light by night. <small>40 </small>
They asked, and the quail came, and he satisfied them with the bread of heaven. <small>41 </small>
He clave the rock, and the waters flowed, rivers ran in dry places. </p>
<p><small>42
</small>For he remembered his holy word, which <i>he 
promised</i> to Abraam his servant. <small>43 </small>
And he brought out his people with exultation, and his chosen 
with joy; <small>44 </small>and 
gave them the lands of the heathen; and they inherited the labours of the 
people; <small>45 </small>that they might keep his 
ordinances, and diligently seek his law.</p>

<h2>Psalm 106</h2>

<p><small>106:1 </small>Give 
thanks to the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy <i>endures</i> for ever.

Remember us, O Lord, with the favour <i>thou hast</i> to

that we may behold the good of thine elect, that we may 
rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that we may glory with thine inheritance.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>We have sinned with our 
fathers, we have transgressed, we have done unrighteously. <small>7 </small>Our fathers in Egypt understood 
not thy wonders, and remembered not the multitude of thy mercy; but provoked <i>
him</i> as they went up by the Red Sea. <small>8 </small>
Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might cause his 
mighty power to be known. <small>9 </small>
And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: so he led them 
through the deep as through the wilderness. <small>10
</small>And he saved them out of the hand of them that 
hated <i>them</i>, and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy. <small>11 </small>The water covered those that oppressed 
them: there was not one of them left. <small>12 </small>
Then they believed his words, and celebrated his praise.
<small>13 </small>They made haste, they forgot his 
works; they waited not for his counsel. <small>14
</small>And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, 
and tempted God in the dry <i>land</i>. <small>15 </small>
And he gave them their request, and sent fullness into their 
souls. </p>
<p><small>16 </small>They provoked Moses also 
in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord. <small>17 </small>The earth opened and swallowed 
up Dathan, and closed upon the congregation of Abiron. <small>18
</small>And a fire was kindled in their congregation, and a flame 
burnt up the sinners. </p>
<p><small>19 </small>
And they made a calf in Choreb, and worshipped the graven image, <small>20 </small>and they changed their glory into the 
similitude of a calf that feeds on grass. <small>21</small> 
They forgot God that saved them, who had wrought great deeds in Egypt; <small>22 </small>wondrous <i>works</i> in the land of Cham, and terrible things at the Red Sea.
<small>23 </small>So he said that he would 
have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to 
turn <i>him</i> away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not 
destroy them. </p>
<p><small>24 </small>Moreover 
they set at nought the desirable land, and believed not his word. <small>25 </small>And they murmured in their tents: they 
hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. <small>26
</small>So he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down 
in the wilderness; <small>27 </small>
and to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the 
countries. </p>
<p><small>28 </small>They were 
joined also to Beelphegor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked 
him with their devices; <small>29 </small>and 
destruction, was multiplied among them. <small>30 </small>
Then Phinees stood up, and made atonement: and the 
plague ceased. <small>31 </small>And it was counted 
to him for righteousness, to all generations for ever. </p>
<p>
<small>32 </small>They provoked him also at the water of 
Strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes; <small>33
</small>for they provoked his spirit, and he spoke <i>
unadvisedly</i> with his lips.</p>

<p><small>34 </small>They destroyed not the 
nations which the Lord told them <i>to destroy</i>; <small>35
</small>but were mingled with the heathen, and learned their 
works. <small>36 </small>And they served their 
graven images; and it became an offence to them. <small>37 </small>And they sacrificed their sons and their 
daughters to devils, <small>38 </small>
and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom 
they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan; and the land was defiled with blood.
<small>39 </small>and was polluted with their 
works; and they went a whoring with their own devices. </p>
<p>
<small>40 </small>So the Lord was very angry with his 
people, and he abhorred his inheritance. <small>41 </small>
And he delivered them into the hands of <i>their</i> 
enemies; and they that hated them ruled over them. <small>42
</small>Ands their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought 
down under their hands. <small>43 </small>
Many a time he delivered them; but they provoked him by their counsel, and they 
were brought low by their iniquities. <small>44 </small>
Ye the Lord looked upon their affliction, when he heard their 
petition. <small>45 </small>And he remembered his 
covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercy.
<small>46 </small>And he caused them to be pitied 
in the sight of all who carried them captive. </p>
<p><small>47
</small>Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the 
heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, that we may glory in thy 
praise. <small>48 </small>Blessed be the Lord God 
of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting; and all the people shall say, 
Amen, Amen.</p>

<h2>Psalm 107</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>107:1 </small>Give 
thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy <i>endures</i> for ever.
<small>2 </small>Let them say <i>so</i> who 
have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
<small>3 </small>and gathered them out of the 
countries, from the east, and west, and north, and south. </p>
<p>
<small>4 </small>They wandered in the wilderness in a dry 
land; they found no way to a city of habitation. <small>
5 </small>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
<small>6 </small>Then they cried to the Lord in 
their affliction, and he delivered them out of their distresses. <small>7 </small>And he guided them into a straight path, 
that they might go to a city of habitation. </p>
<p>
<small>8 </small>Let them acknowledge to the Lord his 
mercies, and his wonderful works to the children of men. <small>9 </small>For he satisfies the empty soul, 
and fills the hungry <i>soul</i> with good things,
<small>10 </small> <i>even</i> them that sit 
in darkness and the shadow of death, fettered in poverty and iron; <small>11 </small>because they rebelled against the words 
of God, and provoked the counsel of the Most High. <small>12 </small>So their heart was brought low with 
troubles; they were weak, and there was no helper. <small>13
</small>Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and he 
saved them out of their distresses. <small>14 </small>
And he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and 
broke their bonds asunder. </p>
<p><small>15 </small>
Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies, and his wonders to 
the children of men. <small>16 </small>
For he broke to pieces the brazen gates, and crushed the iron bars.</p>

<p><small>17 </small>He helped them out of the way of 
their iniquity; for they were brought low because of their iniquities.
<small>18 </small>Their soul abhorred all meat; and 
they drew near to the gates of death. <small>19 </small>
Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and he saved 
them out of their distresses. <small>20 </small>
He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them out of 
their destructions. </p>
<p><small>21 </small>
Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies, and his wonderful works to the 
children of men. <small>22 </small>And let them 
offer to him the sacrifice of praise, and proclaim this works with exultation.</p>

<p><small>23 </small>They that go down to the sea in 
ships, doing business in many waters; <small>24 </small>
these <i>men</i> have seen the works of the Lord, and 
his wonders in the deep. <small>25 </small>He 
speaks, and the stormy wind arises, and its waves are lifted up. <small>26 </small>They go up to the heavens, and go down 
to the depths; their soul melts because of troubles. <small>27 </small>They are troubled, they stagger as a 
drunkard, and all their wisdom is swallowed up. <small>28
</small>Then they cry to the Lord in their affliction, and he 
brings them out of their distresses. <small>29 </small>
And he commands the storm, and it is calmed into a gentle breeze, 
and its waves are still. <small>30 </small>
And they are glad, because they are quiet; and he guides them to 
their desire haven. </p>
<p><small>31 </small>
Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies, and his wonderful works to the 
children of men. <small>32 </small>Let them exalt 
him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.</p>

<p><small>33 </small>He turns rivers into a desert, and 
streams of water into a dry land; <small>34 </small>
a fruitful land into saltness, for the wickedness of 
them that dwell in it. <small>35 </small>He turns a 
wilderness into pools of water, and a dry land into streams of water.
<small>36 </small>And there he causes the hungry to 
dwell, and they establish for themselves cities of habitation. <small>37 </small>And they sow fields, and plant 
vineyards, and they yield fruit of increase. <small>38 </small>
And he blesses them, and they multiply exceedingly, and he 
diminishes not the number of their cattle. <small>39 </small>
Again they become few, and are brought low, by the pressure of 
evils and pain. <small>40 </small>
Contempt is poured upon their princes, and he causes them to wander in a desert 
and trackless land. <small>41 </small>
But he helps the poor out of poverty, and makes <i>him</i> families as 
a flock. <small>42 </small>The upright shall see 
and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. <small>43 </small>Who is wise, and will observe these 
things, and understand the mercies of the Lord?</p>

<h2>Psalm 108</h2>
<h4>Song of a Psalm by David.</h4>
<p><small>108:1 </small>O God, my heart is ready, my heart 
is ready; I will sing and sing psalms with my glory. <small>2 </small>
Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake early. <small>3 </small>
I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the people; I will sing 
praise to thee among the Gentiles. <small>4 </small>
For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth
<i>reaches</i> to the clouds. <small>5 </small>
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.
<small>6 </small>That thy beloved <i>ones</i> 
may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and hear me. God has spoken in his 
sanctuary; <small>7 </small>I will be 
exalted, and will divide Sicima, and will measure out the valley of tents.
<small>8 </small>Galaad is mine; and 
Manasses is mine; and Ephraim is the help of mine head; Judas is my king; <small>9 </small>Moab is the caldron of my hope; 
over Idumea will I cast my sandal; the Philistines are made subject to me.
</p>
<p><small>10 </small>Who will bring me into 
the fortified city? or who will guide me to Idumea? <small>11
</small>Wilt not thou, O God, who hast rejected us? and wilt not 
thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? <small>12 </small>
Give us help from tribulation: for vain is the help of man. <small>13 </small>
Through God we shall do valiantly; and he will bring to nought our enemies.</p>

<h2>Psalm 109</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>109:1 </small>O God, pass not over my praise in 
silence; <small>2
</small>for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the 
crafty <i>man</i> have been opened against me: they have spoken against me with 
a crafty tongue. <small>3 </small>And they have 
compassed me with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
<small>4 </small>Instead of loving me, they falsely 
accused me: but I continued to pray. <small>5 </small>
And they rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>Set thou a sinner against him; and let 
the devil stand at his right hand. <small>7 </small>
When he is judged, let him go forth condemned: and let his prayer 
become sin. <small>8 </small>Let his days be few: 
and let another take his office of overseer. <small>9 </small>Let his children be orphans, and his wife 
a widow. <small>10 </small>Let his children wander 
without a dwelling-place, and beg: let them be cast out of their habitations. <small>11 </small>Let
<i>his</i> creditor exact all that belongs to him: and let strangers spoil his 
labours. <small>12 </small>Let him have no helper; 
neither let there be any one to have compassion on his fatherless children. <small>13 </small>Let his 
children be <i>given up</i> to utter destruction: in one generation let his name 
be blotted out. <small>14 </small>Let the iniquity 
of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother 
be blotted out. <small>15 </small>
Let them be before the Lord continually; and let their memorial be blotted out 
from the earth. </p>
<p><small>16 </small>
Because he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the needy and 
poor man, and <i>that</i> to slay him that was pricked in the heart. <small>17 </small>He loved cursing also, and it shall come 
upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from 
him. <small>18 </small>Yea, he put on cursing as a 
garment, and it is come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones. <small>19 </small>
Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he 
girds himself continually. <small>20 </small>
This is the dealing of the Lord with those who falsely accuse me, 
and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>

<p><small>21 </small>But thou, O Lord, Lord, 
deal <i>mercifully</i> with me, for thy name’s sake: for thy mercy is good.
<small>22 </small>Deliver me, for I am poor and 
needy; and my heart is troubled within me. <small>23
</small>I am removed as a shadow in its going down: I am tossed up 
and down like locusts. <small>24 </small>
My knees are weakened through fasting, and my flesh is changed by 
reason of <i>the want of</i> oil. <small>25 </small>
I became also a reproach to them: <i>when</i> they saw 
me they shook their heads. </p>
<p><small>26 </small>
Help me, O Lord my God; and save me according to thy mercy. <small>27 </small>And let them know that this is 
thy hand; and <i>that</i> thou, Lord, hast wrought it. <small>28
</small>Let them curse, but thou shalt bless: let them 
that rise up against me be ashamed, but let thy servant rejoice. <small>29 </small>Let those that falsely accuse me be 
clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a 
mantle. <small>30 </small>I will give thanks to the 
Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him. <small>31 </small>For he stood 
on the right hand of the poor, to save <i>me</i> from them that persecute my 
soul.</p>

<h2>Psalm 110</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>110:1 </small>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies 
thy footstool. <small>2 </small>The Lord 
shall send out a rod of power for thee out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of 
thine enemies. <small>3 </small>With thee 
is dominion in the day of thy power, in the splendours of thy saints: I have 
begotten thee from the womb before the morning. <small>4 </small>
The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest 
for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.
<small>5 </small>The Lord at thy right hand has dashed 
in pieces kings in the day of his wrath. <small>6
</small>He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill up
<i>the number of</i> corpses, he shall crush the heads of many on the earth.
<small>7 </small> He shall drink of the brook 
in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.</p>

<h2>Psalm 111</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>111:1 </small>I will 
give thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, 
and <i>in</i> the congregation. <small>2 </small>
The works of the Lord are great, sought out according to all his will.
<small>3 </small>His work is <i>worthy of</i> 
thanksgiving and honour: and his righteousness endures for ever and ever. <small>4 </small>He has caused his wonderful works to be 
remembered: the Lord is merciful and compassionate. <small>
5 </small>He has given food to them that fear him: he will 
remember his covenant for ever.
<small>6 </small>He has declared to his people the 
power of his works, to give them the inheritance of the heathen.
<small>7 </small>The works of his hands are truth 
and judgment: all his commandments are sure: <small>8
</small>established for ever and ever, done in truth and 
uprightness. <small>9 </small>He sent redemption to 
his people: he commanded his covenant for ever: holy and fearful is his name. <small>10 </small>
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and all that act accordingly 
have a good understanding; his praise endures for ever and ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 112</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>112:1 </small>Blessed is the man that fears the 
Lord: he will delight greatly in his commandments. <small>2 </small>His seed shall be mighty in the earth: 
the generation of the upright shall be blessed. <small>3
</small>Glory and riches shall be in his house; and his 
righteousness endures for evermore. <small>4 </small>
To the upright light has sprung up in darkness: he is pitiful, 
and merciful, and righteous. <small>5 </small>
The good man is he that pities and lends: he will direct his 
affairs with judgment.
<small>6 </small>For he shall not be moved for ever; 
the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. <small>7 </small>He shall not be afraid of <i>any</i> 
evil report: his heart is ready to trust in the Lord. <small>8
</small>His heart is established, he shall not fear, till 
he shall see <i>his desire</i> upon his enemies. <small>9 </small>
He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor; his 
righteousness endures for evermore: his horn shall be exalted with honour.
<small>10 </small>The sinner shall see and be 
angry, he shall gnash his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the sinner 
shall perish.</p>
<h2>Psalm 113</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>113:1 </small>Praise the 
Lord, ye servants <i>of his</i>, praise, the name of the Lord. <small>2 </small>Let the name of the Lord be blessed, from 
this present time and for ever. <small>3 </small>
From the rising of the sun to his setting, the name of the Lord 
is to be praised. <small>4 </small>The Lord is high 
above all the nations; his glory is above the heavens. </p>
<p>
<small>5 </small>Who is as the Lord our God? who dwells in 
the high places, <small>6 </small>and <i>yet</i> looks upon the low things in heaven, and on the earth: <small>7 </small>who lifts up the poor from the earth, and 
raises up the needy from the dunghill; <small>8 </small>
to set him with princes, <i>even</i> with the princes of 
his people: <small>9 </small>who settles 
the barren <i>woman</i> in a house, <i>as</i> a mother rejoicing over children.</p>
<h2>Psalm 114</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>114:1 </small>At the going forth of Israel from 
Egypt, of the house of Jacob from a barbarous people,
<small>2 </small>Judea became his 
sanctuary, <i>and</i> Israel his dominion. <small>3 </small>
The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back. <small>4 </small>The mountains skipped like rams, and the 
hills like lambs. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>What <i>ailed</i> thee, O sea, that thou fleddest? and thou Jordan, that thou 
wast turned back? <small>6 </small> <i>Ye</i> 
mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and <i>ye</i> hills, like lambs? <small>7 </small>The earth trembled at the presence of the 
Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; <small>8 </small>who turned the rock into pools of water, 
and the flint into fountains of water.</p>
<h2>Psalm 115</h2>
<p><small>115:1 </small>Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but 
to thy name give glory, because of thy mercy and thy truth; <small>2 </small>lest at any time the nations should say, 
Where is their God? <small>3 </small>
But our God has done in heaven and on earth, whatsoever he has pleased.
</p>
<p><small>4 </small>The idols of the nations are 
silver and gold, the works of men’s hands. <small>5 </small>
They have a mouth, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but 
they cannot see: <small>6 </small>they have ears, 
but they cannot hear; they have noses, but they cannot smell; <small>7 </small>they have hands, but they cannot handle; 
they have feet, but they cannot walk: they cannot speak through their throat. <small>8 </small>
Let those that make them become like to them, and all who trust in them.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>The house of Israel trusts in the 
Lord: he is their helper and defender. <small>10 </small>
The house of Aaron trusts in the Lord: he is their helper and 
defender. <small>11 </small>They that fear the Lord 
trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
</p>
<p><small>12 </small>The Lord has remembered us, and 
blessed us: he has blessed the house of Israel, he has blessed the house of 
Aaron. <small>13 </small>He has blessed them that 
fear the Lord, both small and great. <small>14 </small>
The Lord add <i>blessings</i> to you and to your 
children. <small>15 </small>Blessed are ye of the 
Lord, who made the heaven and the earth. </p>
<p><small>16 </small>
The heaven of heavens <i>belongs</i> to the Lord: but he 
has given the earth to the sons of men. <small>17 </small>
The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord, nor any that go down to 
Hades. <small>18 </small>But we, the living, will 
bless the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 116</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>116:1 </small>I am well pleased, because the 
Lord will hearken to the voice of my supplication. <small>2 </small>Because he has inclined his ear to me, 
therefore will I call upon him while I live. <small>3
</small>The pangs of death compassed me; the dangers of hell found 
me: I found affliction and sorrow. <small>4</small> 
Then I called on the name of the Lord: O Lord, deliver my soul. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>
The Lord is merciful and righteous; yea, our God has pity. <small>6 </small>
The Lord preserves the simple: I was brought low, and he 
delivered me. </p>
<p><small>7 </small>Return to thy rest, 
O my soul; for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee. <small>8 </small>For he has delivered my soul from death, 
mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. <small>9
</small>I shall be well-pleasing before the Lord in the land of 
the living. 
</p>
<p>Alleluia:</p>
<p><small>10 </small>I believed, wherefore I have spoken: 
but I was greatly afflicted. <small>11 </small>
And I said in mine amazement, Every man is a liar.
<small>12 </small>What shall I render to the Lord 
for all the things wherein he has rewarded me? <small>13
</small>I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name 
of the Lord. <small>14 </small>I will pay my vows 
to the Lord, in the presence of all his people. </p>
<p>
<small>15 </small>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the 
death of his saints. <small>16 </small>
O Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine 
handmaid: thou hast burst by bonds asunder. <small>17 </small>
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise, and will call upon 
the name of the Lord. <small>18 </small>
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the presence of all his people,
<small>19 </small>in the courts of the Lord’s 
house, in the midst of thee, Jerusalem.</p>

<h2>Psalm 117</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>117:1 </small>Praise the Lord, all ye nations: 
praise him, all ye peoples. <small>2 </small>
For his mercy has been abundant toward us: and the truth of the 
Lord endures for ever.</p>

<h2>Psalm 118</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>118:1 </small>Give 
thanks to the Lord; for <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endures</i> for 
ever. <small>2 </small>Let now the house of 
Israel say, that <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endures</i> for ever.
<small>3 </small>Let now the house of Aaron 
say, that <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endures</i> for ever. <small>4 </small>Let now all that fear the Lord 
say, that <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endures</i> for ever. </p>
<p>
<small>5 </small>I called on the Lord out of 
affliction: and he hearkened to me, <i>so as to bring me</i> into a wide place.
<small>6 </small>The Lord is my helper; and I will 
not fear what man shall do to me. <small>7 </small>
The Lord is my helper; and I shall see <i>my desire</i> 
upon mine enemies. <small>8 </small> <i>It 
is</i> better to trust in the Lord than to trust in man. <small>9
</small> <i>It is</i> better to hope in the Lord, than to 
hope in princes. </p>
<p><small>10 </small>All nations 
compassed me about: but in the name of the Lord I repulsed them. <small>11 </small>They completely compassed me about: but 
in the name of the Lord I repulsed them. <small>12
</small>They compassed me about as bees <i>do</i> a honeycomb, and 
they burst into flame as fire among thorns: but in the name of the Lord I 
repulsed them. <small>13 </small>I was thrust, and 
sorely shaken, that I might fall: but the Lord helped me. </p>
<p>
<small>14 </small>The Lord is my strength and my song, and 
is become my salvation. <small>15 </small>
The voice of exultation and salvation is in the tabernacles of 
the righteous: the right hand of the Lord has wrought mightily.
<small>16 </small>The right hand of the Lord has 
exalted me: the right hand of the Lord has wrought powerfully. <small>17 </small>I shall not die, but live, and recount 
the works of the Lord. <small>18 </small>
The Lord has chastened me sore: but he has not given me up to death.</p>

<p><small>19 </small>Open to me the gates of 
righteousness: I will go into them, and give praise to the Lord. <small>20 </small>This is the gate of the Lord: the 
righteous shall enter by it. <small>21 </small>
I will give thanks to thee; because thou hast heard me, and art become my 
salvation. <small>22 </small>The stone which the 
builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner. <small>23 </small>This has been done of the Lord; and it 
is wonderful in our eyes. <small>24 </small>
This is the day which the Lord has made: let us exult and rejoice in it. <small>25 </small>
O Lord, save now: O Lord, send now prosperity. <small>26 </small>
Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the 
house of the Lord. </p>
<p><small>27 </small>
God is the Lord, and he has shined upon us: celebrate the feast with 
thick <i>branches, binding the victims</i> even to the horns of the altar.
<small>28 </small>Thou art my God, and I will give 
thee thanks: thou art my God, and I will exalt thee. I will give thanks to thee, 
for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. <small>29 </small>Give thanks to the Lord; for he 
is good: for his mercy <i>endures</i> for ever.</p>
<h2>Psalm 119</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>119:1 </small>Blessed are the blameless in the 
way, who walk in the law of the Lord. <small>2 </small>Blessed are they that search out his 
testimonies: they will diligently seek him with the whole heart. <small>3 </small>For they that work iniquity have not 
walked in his ways.
<small>4 </small>Thou hast commanded <i>us</i> 
diligently to keep thy precepts. <small>5 </small>
O that my ways were directed to keep thine ordinances. <small>6 </small>Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have 
respect to all thy commandments.
<small>7 </small>I will give thee thanks with 
uprightness of heart, when I have learnt the judgments of thy righteousness.
<small>8 </small>I will keep thine 
ordinances: O forsake me not greatly.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>Wherewith shall a young man direct his 
way? by keeping thy words.
<small>10 </small>With my whole heart have I diligently 
sought thee: cast me not away from thy commandments.
<small>11 </small>I have hidden thine 
oracles in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.
<small>12 </small>Blessed art thou, O Lord: 
teach me thine ordinances.
<small>13 </small>With my lips have I declared all the 
judgments of thy mouth. <small>14 </small>
I have delighted in the way of thy testimonies, <i>as 
much</i> as in all riches. <small>15 </small>
I will meditate on thy commandments, and consider thy ways. <small>16 </small>I will meditate on thine 
ordinances: I will not forget thy words.</p>

<p><small>17 </small>Render a recompense to thy 
servant: <i>so</i> shall I live, and keep thy words.
<small>18 </small>Unveil thou mine eyes, and I shall 
perceive wondrous things of thy law.
<small>19 </small>I am a stranger in the earth: hide 
not thy commandments from me.
<small>20 </small>My soul has longed exceedingly for 
thy judgments at all times.
<small>21 </small>Thou has rebuked the proud: cursed 
are they that turn aside from thy commandments.
<small>22 </small>Remove from me reproach and contempt; 
for I have sought out thy testimonies.
<small>23 </small>For princes sat and spoke 
against me: but thy servant was meditating on thine ordinances.
<small>24 </small>For thy testimonies are my 
meditation, and thine ordinances are my counsellors.
</p>
<p><small>25 </small>My soul has cleaved to the ground; 
quicken thou me according to thy word.
<small>26 </small>I declared my ways, and 
thou didst hear me: teach me thine ordinances. <small>27 </small>
Instruct me in the way of thine ordinances; and I will 
meditate on thy wondrous works.
<small>28 </small>My soul has slumbered for sorrow; 
strengthen thou me with thy words. <small>29 </small>
Remove from me the way of iniquity; and be merciful to me by thy 
law.
<small>30 </small>I have chosen the way of truth; and 
have not forgotten thy judgments. <small>31 </small>
I have cleaved to thy testimonies, O Lord; put me not to shame. <small>32 </small>
I ran the way of thy commandments, when thou didst enlarge my heart.</p>

<p><small>33 </small>Teach me, O Lord, the way 
of thine ordinances, and I will seek it out continually. <small>
34 </small>Instruct me, and I will search out thy law, and will 
keep it with my whole heart.
<small>35 </small>Guide me in the path of thy 
commandments; for I have delighted in it. <small>36 </small>
Incline mine heart to thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
<small>37 </small>Turn away mine eyes that I may not 
behold vanity: quicken thou me in thy way.
<small>38 </small>Confirm thine oracle to 
thy servant, that he may fear thee.
<small>39 </small>Take away my reproach which I have 
feared: for thy judgments are good.
<small>40 </small>Behold, I have desired thy 
commandments: quicken me in thy righteousness.</p>

<p><small>41 </small>And let thy mercy come 
upon me, O Lord; <i>even</i> thy salvation, according to thy word. <small>42 </small>And <i>so</i> I shall render an 
answer to them that reproach me: for I have trusted in thy words.
<small>43 </small>And take not the word of truth 
utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. So shall I keep thy 
law continually, for ever and ever.
<small>45 </small>I walked also at large: for I sought 
out thy commandments. <small>46 </small>
And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings, and was not ashamed. <small>47 </small>
And I meditated on thy commandments, which I loved exceedingly. <small>48 </small>
And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments which I 
loved; and I meditated in thine ordinances.</p>

<p><small>49 </small>Remember thy words to thy servant, 
wherein thou hast made me hope.
<small>50 </small>This has comforted me in 
mine affliction: for thine oracle has quickened me.
<small>51 </small>The proud have transgressed 
exceedingly; but I swerved not from thy law.
<small>52 </small>I remembered thy judgements of old, O Lord; and was comforted.
<small>53 </small>Despair took hold upon me, because of 
the sinners who forsake thy law.
<small>54 </small>Thine ordinances were my 
songs in the place of my sojourning.
<small>55 </small>I remembered thy name, O Lord, in the 
night, and kept thy law. <small>56 </small>
This I had, because I diligently sought thine 
ordinances.</p>

<p><small>57 </small>Thou art my portion, O Lord: I said 
that I would keep thy law.
<small>58 </small>I besought thy favour with 
my whole heart: have mercy upon me according to thy word.
<small>59 </small>I thought on thy ways, and turned my 
feet to thy testimonies. <small>60 </small>
I prepared myself, (and was not terrified,) to keep thy 
commandments.
<small>61 </small>The snares of sinners entangled me: 
but I forgot not thy law.
<small>62 </small>At midnight I arose, to give thanks 
to thee for the judgments of thy righteousness.
<small>63 </small>I am a companion of all them that 
fear thee, and of them that keep thy commandments.
<small>64 </small>O Lord, the earth is full 
of thy mercy: teach me thine ordinances.
</p>
<p><small>65 </small>Thou hast wrought kindly with thy 
servant, o Lord, according to thy word. <small>66 </small>
Teach me kindness, and instruction, and knowledge: for I have 
believed thy commandments.
<small>67 </small>Before I was afflicted, I 
transgressed; therefore have I kept thy word.
<small>68 </small>Good art thou, O Lord; 
therefore in thy goodness teach me thine ordinances.
<small>69 </small>The injustice of the proud has been 
multiplied against me: but I will search out thy commandments with all my heart. <small>70 </small>
Their heart has been curdled like milk; but I have meditated on thy law.
<small>71 </small> <i>It is</i> good for me 
that thou hast afflicted me; that I might learn thine ordinances.
<small>72 </small>The law of thy mouth is better to me 
than thousands of gold and silver.</p>

<p><small>73 </small>Thy hands have made me, and fashioned 
me: instruct me, that I may learn thy commandments.
<small>74 </small>They that fear thee will see me and 
rejoice: for I have hoped in thy words.
<small>75 </small>I know, O Lord, that thy 
judgments are righteousness, and <i>that</i> thou in truthfulness hast afflicted 
me.
<small>76 </small>Let, I pray thee, thy mercy be to 
comfort me, according to thy word to thy servant. <small>77 </small>Let thy compassions come to me, that I 
may live: for thy law is my meditation.
<small>78 </small>Let the proud be ashamed; for they 
transgressed against me unjustly: but I will meditate in thy commandments. <small>79 </small>
Let those that fear thee, and those that know thy testimonies, turn to me.
<small>80 </small>Let mine heart be 
blameless in thine ordinances, that I may not be ashamed.</p>

<p><small>81 </small>My soul faints for thy salvation: I 
have hoped in thy words. <small>82 </small>
Mine eyes failed <i>in waiting</i> for thy word, saying, 
When wilt thou comfort me?
<small>83 </small>For I am become as a 
bottle in the frost: <i>yet</i> I have not forgotten thine ordinances.
<small>84 </small>How many are the days of thy servant? 
when wilt thou execute judgment for me on them that persecute me?
<small>85 </small>Transgressors told me <i>
idle tales</i>; but not according to thy law, O Lord. <small>86
</small>All thy commandments are truth; they persecuted me 
unjustly; help thou me. <small>87 </small>
They nearly made an end of me in the earth; but I forsook not thy commandments.
<small>88 </small>Quicken me according to thy mercy; so 
shall I keep the testimonies of thy mouth.</p>

<p><small>89 </small>Thy word, O Lord, abides in heaven 
for ever. <small>90 </small>Thy 
truth <i>endures</i> to all generations; thou hast founded the earth, and it 
abides. <small>91 </small>The day continues by thy 
arrangement; for all things are thy servants.
<small>92 </small>Were it not that thy law is my 
meditation, then I should have perished in mine affliction.
<small>93 </small>I will never forget thine 
ordinances; for with them thou hast quickened me.
<small>94 </small>I am thine, save me; for I 
have sought out thine ordinances.
<small>95 </small>Sinners laid wait for me 
to destroy me; <i>but</i> I understood thy testimonies.
<small>96 </small> have seen an end of all 
perfection; <i>but</i> thy commandment is very broad.
</p>
<p><small>97 </small>How I have loved thy law, O Lord! it 
is my meditation all the day.
<small>98 </small>Thou hast made me wiser 
than mine enemies <i>in</i> thy commandment; for it is mine for ever. <small>99 </small>I have more understanding than all my 
teachers; for thy testimonies are my medication. <small>
100 </small>I understand more that the aged; because I have sought 
out thy commandments.
<small>101 </small>I have kept back my feet from every 
evil way, that I might keep thy words.
<small>102 </small>I have not declined from thy 
judgments; for thou hast instructed me.</p>

<p><small>103 </small>How sweet are thine 
oracles to my throat! more so than honey to my mouth! <small>104
</small>I gain understanding by thy commandments: therefore I have 
hated every way of unrighteousness.</p>

<p><small>105 </small>Thy law is a lamp to my feet, and a 
light to my paths.
<small>106 </small>I have sworn and determined to keep 
the judgments of thy righteousness.
<small>107 </small>I have been very greatly afflicted, 
O Lord: quicken me, according to thy word.
<small>108 </small>Accept, I pray thee, O Lord, the 
freewill-offerings of my mouth, and teach me thy judgments.
<small>109 </small>My soul is continually in thine hands; and I have not forgotten thy law. <small>110
</small>Sinners spread a snare for me; but I erred not from thy 
commandments.
<small>111 </small>I have inherited thy testimonies for 
ever; for they are the joy of my heart. <small>
112 </small>I have inclined my heart to perform thine 
ordinances for ever, in return <i>for thy mercies</i>.</p>

<p><small>113 </small>I have hated transgressors; but I 
have loved thy law.
<small>114 </small>Thou art my helper and my supporter; 
I have hoped in thy words.
<small>115 </small>Depart from me, ye evil-doers; for I 
will search out the commandments of my God.
<small>116 </small>Uphold me according to thy word, and 
quicken me; and make me not ashamed of my expectation. <small>117 </small>Help me, and I shall be 
saved; and I will meditate in thine ordinances continually.
<small>118 </small>Thou hast brought to nought all that depart from thine ordinances; for their inward thought is 
unrighteous. <small>119 </small>I have reckoned all 
the sinners of the earth as transgressors; therefore have I loved thy 
testimonies. <small>120 </small>Penetrate my flesh 
with thy fear; for I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>

<p><small>121 </small>I have done judgment and justice; 
deliver me not up to them that injure me. <small>122
</small>Receive thy servant for good: let not the proud accuse me 
falsely.
<small>123 </small>Mine eyes have failed for thy 
salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.
<small>124 </small>Deal with thy servant 
according to thy mercy, and teach me thine ordinances. <small>125
</small>I am thy servant; instruct me, and I shall know thy 
testimonies.
<small>126 </small> <i>It is</i> time for 
the Lord to work: they have utterly broken thy law.
<small>127 </small>Therefore have I loved thy 
commandments more than gold, or the topaz. <small>128 </small>
Therefore I directed myself <i>according</i> to all thy 
commandments: I have hated every unjust way.</p>

<p><small>129 </small>Thy testimonies are wonderful: 
therefore my soul has sought them out.
<small>130 </small>The manifestation of thy words will 
enlighten, and instruct the simple.
<small>131 </small>I opened my mouth, and drew breath: 
for I earnestly longed after thy commandments.
<small>132 </small>Look upon me and have mercy upon me, 
after the manner of them that love thy name.
<small>133 </small>Order my steps according to thy 
word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
<small>134 </small>Deliver me from the false accusation 
of men: so will I keep thy commandments.
<small>135 </small>Cause thy face to shine 
upon thy servant: and teach me thine ordinances.
<small>136 </small>Mine eyes have been bathed in 
streams of water, because I kept not thy law.</p>

<p><small>137 </small>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and 
upright are thy judgments. <small>138 </small>
Thou has commanded righteousness and perfect truth, <i>
as</i> thy testimonies.
<small>139 </small>Thy zeal has quite wasted me: 
because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.
<small>140 </small>Thy word <i>has been</i> 
very fully tried; and thy servant loves it.
<small>141 </small>I am young and despised:
<i>yet</i> I have not forgotten thine ordinances.
<small>142 </small>Thy righteousness is an everlasting 
righteousness, and thy law is truth.
<small>143 </small>Afflictions and 
distresses found me: <i>but</i> thy commandments <i>were</i> my meditation.
<small>144 </small>Thy testimonies <i>are</i> 
an everlasting righteousness: instruct me, and I shall live.</p>

<p><small>145 </small>I cried with my whole 
heart; hear me, O Lord: I will search out thine ordinances. <small>146 </small>I cried to thee; save me, and I will 
keep thy testimonies.
<small>147 </small>I arose before the dawn, and cried: 
I hoped in thy words. <small>148 </small>
Mine eyes prevented the dawn, that I might meditate on thine oracles.
<small>149 </small>Hear my voice, O Lord, according to 
thy mercy; quicken me according to thy judgment.
<small>150 </small>They have drawn nigh who persecuted 
me unlawfully; and they are far removed from thy law. <small>151</small> Thou art near, O Lord; and all thy ways 
are truth.
<small>152 </small>I have known of old concerning thy 
testimonies, that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>

<p><small>153 </small>Look upon mine affliction, and 
rescue me; for I have not forgotten thy law. <small>154 </small>Plead my cause, and ransom me: quicken 
me because of thy word.
<small>155 </small>Salvation is far from 
sinners: for they have not searched out thine ordinances.
<small>156 </small>Thy mercies, O Lord, are many: 
quicken me according to thy judgment.
<small>157 </small>Many are they that 
persecute me and oppress me: <i>but</i> I have not declined from thy 
testimonies.
<small>158 </small>I beheld men acting 
foolishly, and I pined away; for they kept not thine oracles.
<small>159 </small>Behold, I have loved thy 
commandments, O Lord: quicken me in thy mercy.
<small>160 </small>The beginning of thy 
words is truth; and all the judgments of thy righteousness <i>endure</i> for 
ever.</p>

<p><small>161 </small>Princes persecuted me without a 
cause, but my heart feared because of thy words.
<small>162 </small>I will exult because of thine oracles, as one that finds much spoil.
<small>163 </small>I hate and abhor unrighteousness; 
but I love thy law.
<small>164 </small>Seven times in a day have I praised 
thee because of the judgments of thy righteousness.
<small>165 </small>Great peace have they that love thy 
law: and there is no stumbling-block to them.
<small>166 </small>I waited for thy salvation, O Lord, 
and have loved thy commandments.
<small>167 </small>My soul has kept thy testimonies, 
and loved them exceedingly. <small>168</small> I 
have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies; for all my ways are before thee, 
O Lord.</p>

<p><small>169 </small>Let my supplication come 
near before thee, o Lord; instruct me according to thine oracle. <small>170 </small>Let my petition come in 
before thee, O Lord; deliver me according to thine oracle.
<small>171 </small>Let my lips utter a 
hymn, when thou shalt have taught me thine ordinances.
<small>172 </small>Let my tongue utter thine oracles; for all thy commandments are righteous.
<small>173 </small>Let thine hand be <i>
prompt</i> to save me; for I have chosen thy commandments. <small>174 </small>I have longed after thy salvation, O 
Lord; and thy law is my meditation.
<small>175 </small>My soul shall live, and 
shall praise thee; and thy judgments shall help me.
<small>176 </small>I have gone astray like a lost 
sheep; seek thy servant; for I have not forgotten thy commandments.</p>

<h2>Psalm 120</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>120:1 </small>In mine affliction I cried to the 
Lord, and he hearkened to me. <small>2 </small>Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unjust 
lips, and from a deceitful tongue. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>
What should be given to thee, and what should be added to 
thee, for <i>thy</i> crafty tongue? <small>4 </small>
Sharpened weapons of the mighty, with coals of the desert.</p>

<p><small>5 </small>Woe is me, that my sojourning is 
prolonged; I have tabernacled among the tents of Kedar. <small>6 </small>My soul has long been a sojourner; <small>7 </small>
I was peaceable among them that hated peace; when I spoke to them, they warred 
against me without a cause.</p>
<h2>Psalm 121</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>121:1 </small>I lifted up mine eyes to the 
mountains, whence my help shall come. <small>2 </small>My help <i>shall come</i> from 
the Lord, who made the heaven and the earth. <small>3 </small>
Let not thy foot be moved; and let not thy keeper slumber. <small>4 </small>
Behold, he that keeps Israel shall not slumber nor sleep. <small>5 </small>
The Lord shall keep thee: the Lord is thy shelter upon thy right 
hand. <small>6 </small>The sun shall not burn thee 
by day, neither the moon by night. <small>7
</small>May the Lord preserve thee from all evil: the Lord shall 
keep thy soul. <small>8 </small>The Lord shall keep 
thy coming in, and thy going out, from henceforth and even for ever.</p>
<h2>Psalm 122</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>122:1 </small>I was glad when they said to me, 
Let us go into the house of the Lord. <small>2 </small>Our feet stood in thy courts, O 
Jerusalem. <small>3 </small>Jerusalem is built as a 
city whose fellowship is complete. <small>4 </small>
For thither the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, as a 
testimony for Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. <small>5 </small>For there are set thrones for judgement, <i>even</i> thrones for the house of David.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>Pray now for the peace of 
Jerusalem: and <i>let there be</i> prosperity to them that love thee. <small>7 </small>Let peace, I pray, be within thine host, and prosperity in thy palaces. <small>8 </small>
For the sake of my brethren and my neighbours, I have 
indeed spoken peace concerning thee. <small>9 </small>
Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have diligently 
sought thy good.</p>
<h2>Psalm 123</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>123:1 </small>Unto thee who dwellest in heaven have I lifted up mine eyes. <small>2 </small>Behold, as the eyes of servants
<i>are directed</i> to the hands of their masters, <i>and</i> as the eyes of a 
maidservant to the hands of her mistress; so our eyes <i>are directed</i> to the 
Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us. <small>3 </small>
Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: for we are 
exceedingly filled with contempt. <small>4 </small>
<i>Yea</i>, our soul has been exceedingly filled <i>with it</i>: <i>let</i> 
the reproach <i>be</i> to them that are at ease, and contempt to the proud.</p>
<h2>Psalm 124</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>124:1 </small>If it had not been that the Lord 
was among us, let Israel now say; <small>2 </small>if it had not been that the Lord was 
among us, when men rose up against us; <small>3 </small>
verily they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath 
was kindled against us: <small>4 </small>
verily the water would have drowned us, our soul would have gone under the 
torrent. <small>5 </small>Yea, our soul would have 
gone under the overwhelming water.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>Blessed be the Lord, who has not given 
us for a prey to their teeth. <small>7 </small>
Our soul has been delivered as a sparrow from the snare of the 
fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are delivered. <small>8 </small>Our help is in the name of the Lord, who 
made heaven and earth.</p>
<h2>Psalm 125</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>125:1 </small>They that trust in the Lord <i>shall be</i> as mount Sion: he that dwells in 
Jerusalem shall never be moved. <small>2 </small>
The mountains are round about her, and <i>so</i> the Lord is round about 
his people, from henceforth and even for ever. <small>3 </small>
For the Lord will not allow the rod of sinners to be upon the lot 
of the righteous; lest the righteous should stretch forth their hands to 
iniquity.</p>

<p><small>4 </small>Do good, O Lord, to them <i>
that are</i> good, and to them <i>that are</i> upright in heart. <small>5 </small>But them that turn aside to 
crooked ways the Lord will lead away with the workers of iniquity: <i>but</i> 
peace <i>shall be</i> upon Israel.</p>
<h2>Psalm 126</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>126:1 </small>When the Lord turned the captivity of Sion, we became as comforted ones. <small>2 </small>Then was our mouth filled with joy, and 
our tongue with exultation: then would they say among the Gentiles,
<small>3 </small>The Lord has done great things 
among them. The Lord has done great things for us, we became joyful.</p>

<p><small>4 </small>Turn, O Lord, our captivity, as the 
steams in the south. <small>5 </small>
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. <small>6 </small>
They went on and wept as they cast their seeds; but they 
shall surely come with exultation, bringing their sheaves <i>with them</i>.</p>
<h2>Psalm 127</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>127:1 </small>Except the Lord build the house, they that build labour in vain: except the Lord 
keep the city, the watchman watches in vain. <small>2 </small>
It is vain for you to rise early: ye rise up after resting, ye 
that eat the bread of grief; while he gives sleep to his beloved.
</p>
<p><small>3 </small>Behold, the inheritance of the 
Lord, children, the reward of the fruit of the womb. <small>4
</small>As arrows in the hand of a mighty man; so are the children 
of those who were outcasts. <small>5 </small>
Blessed is the man who shall satisfy his desire with them: they 
shall not be ashamed when they shall speak to their enemies in the gates.</p>
<h2>Psalm 128</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>128:1 </small>Blessed are all they that fear the 
Lord; who walk in his ways. <small>2 </small>Thou shalt eat the labours of thy 
hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee. <small>3
</small>Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine on the sides of thy 
house: thy children as young olive-plants round about thy table. </p>
<p>
<small>4 </small>Behold, thus shall the man be blessed 
that fears the Lord. <small>5 </small>
May the Lord bless thee out of Sion; and mayest thou see the prosperity 
of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. <small>6 </small>
And mayest thou see thy children’s children. Peace be 
upon Israel.</p>
<h2>Psalm 129</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>129:1 </small>Many a time have they warred 
against me from my youth, let Israel now say:
<small>2 </small>Many a time have they warred 
against me from my youth: and yet they prevailed not against me. <small>3 </small>The sinners wrought upon my back: they 
prolonged their iniquity. <small>4 </small>
The righteous Lord has cut asunder the necks of sinners.</p>

<p><small>5 </small>Let all that hate Sion be 
put to shame and turned back. <small>6 </small>
Let them be as the grass of the house-tops, which withers before it is plucked 
up. <small>7 </small>Wherewith the reaper fills not 
his hand, nor he that makes up the sheaves, his bosom. <small>8 </small>Neither do they that go by say, The 
blessing of the Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.</p>
<h2>Psalm 130</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>130:1 </small>Out of the depths have I cried to 
thee, O Lord. <small>2 </small>
O Lord, hearken to my voice; let thine ears be attentive 
to the voice of my supplication. <small>3 </small>
If thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
<small>4 </small>For with thee is forgiveness: for 
thy name’s sake
<small>5 </small>have I waited for thee, O Lord, my 
soul has waited for thy word. <small>6 </small>
My soul has hoped in the Lord; from the morning watch till night. </p>
<p><small>7 </small>
Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord is mercy, and with him is 
plenteous redemption. <small>8 </small>And he shall 
redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p>
<h2>Psalm 131</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>131:1 </small>O 
Lord, my heart is not exalted, neither have mine eyes been <i>haughtily</i> 
raised: neither have I exercised myself in great <i>matters</i>, nor in things 
too wonderful for me. <small>2 </small> <i>I 
shall have sinned</i> if I have not been humble, but have exulted my soul: 
according to <i>the relation of</i> a weaned child to his mother, so wilt thou 
recompense my soul. <small>3 </small>Let Israel 
hope in the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</p>
<h2>Psalm 132</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>132:1 </small>Lord, remember David, and all his 
meekness: <small>2 </small>
how he sware to the Lord, <i>and</i> vowed to the God of 
Jacob, <i>saying</i>, <small>3 </small>I will not 
go into the tabernacle of my house; I will not go up to the couch of my bed; <small>4 </small>
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids, nor rest to my 
temples, <small>5 </small>until I find a place for the Lord, a 
tabernacle for the God of Jacob. <small>6 </small>
Behold, we heard of it in Ephratha; we found it in the 
fields of the wood. <small>7 </small>Let us enter 
into his tabernacles: let us worship at the place where his feet stood.
</p>
<p><small>8 </small>Arise, O Lord, into thy 
rest; thou, and the ark of thine holiness. <small>9 </small>
Thy priests shall clothe themselves with righteousness; and thy 
saints shall exult. <small>10 </small>
For the sake of thy servant David turn not away the face of thine 
anointed.</p>

<p><small>11 </small>The Lord sware <i>in</i> 
truth to David, and he will not annul it, <i>saying</i>, Of the fruit of thy 
body will I set <i>a king</i> upon thy throne. <small>12 </small>
If thy children will deep my covenant, and these my testimonies 
which I shall teach them, their children also shall sit upon thy throne for 
ever. <small>13 </small>For the 
Lord has elected Sion, he has chosen her for a habitation for himself, <i>saying</i>,
<small>14 </small>This is my rest for ever: here 
will I dwell; for I have chosen it. <small>15 </small>
I will surely bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with 
bread. <small>16 </small>I will clothe her priests 
with salvation; and her saints shall greatly exult. <small>17 </small>There will I cause to spring up a horn 
to David: I have prepared a lamp for mine anointed. <small>18 </small>His enemies will I clothe with a shame; 
but upon himself shall my holiness flourish.</p>
<h2>Psalm 133</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>133:1 </small>See now! what is so good, or what 
so pleasant, as for brethren to dwell together? <small>2 </small> <i>It is</i> as 
ointment on the head, that ran down to the beard, <i>even</i> the beard of 
Aaron; that ran down to the fringe of his clothing. <small>3
</small>As the dew of Aermon, that comes down on the 
mountains of Sion: for there, the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for 
ever.</p>
<h2>Psalm 134</h2>
<h4>A Song of Degrees.</h4>
<p><small>134:1 </small>Behold now, bless ye the Lord, all 
the servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of 
the house of our God. <small>
2 </small>Lift up your hands by night in the sanctuaries, and 
bless the Lord. <small>3 </small>May 
the Lord, who made heaven and earth, bless thee out of Sion.</p>
<h2>Psalm 135</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>135:1 </small>Praise ye 
the name of the Lord; praise the Lord, <i>ye his</i> servants, <small>2 </small>who stand in the house of the Lord, in 
the courts of the house of our God. <small>3 </small>
Praise ye the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises to 
his name; for <i>it is</i> good. </p>
<p><small>4 </small>
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, <i>and</i> Israel for his 
peculiar treasure.
<small>5 </small>For I know that the Lord is great, and 
our Lord is above all gods; <small>6 </small>
all that the Lord willed, he did in heaven, and on the earth, in 
the sea, and in all deeps. <small>7 </small>
Who brings up clouds from the extremity of the earth: he 
has made lightnings for the rain: he brings winds out of his treasures. <small>8 </small>Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both 
of man and beast. <small>9 </small>
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, on Pharao, 
and on all his servants. <small>10 </small>Who 
smote many nations, and slew mighty kings; <small>11 </small>
Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, and all 
the kingdoms of Chanaan: <small>12 </small>and gave their land <i>for</i> an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his 
people. </p>
<p><small>13 </small>O Lord, thy name
<i>endures</i> for ever, and thy memorial to all generations. <small>14 </small>For the Lord shall judge his people, and 
comfort himself concerning his servants.
<small>15 </small>The idols of the heathen are silver 
and gold, the works of men’s hands. <small>16 </small>
They have a mouth, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but 
they cannot see; <small>17 </small>
they have ears, but they cannot hear; for there is no breath in their mouth. <small>18 </small>
Let those who make them be made like to them; and all those who trust in them. </p>
<p>
<small>19 </small>O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord: O 
house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord: <small>20 </small>
O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord: ye that fear the Lord, bless 
the Lord. <small>21 </small>Blessed in Sion be the Lord, who dwells in Jerusalem.</p>

<h2>Psalm 137</h2>
<h4>For David, <i>a Psalm</i> 
of Jeremias.</h4>
<p><small>137:1 </small>By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat; and wept when we 
remembered Sion. <small>2 </small>We hung our harps 
on the willows in the midst of it. <small>3 </small>
For there they that had taken us captive asked of us the 
words of a song; and they that had carried us away <i>asked</i> a hymn, <i>
saying</i>, Sing us <i>one</i> of the songs of Sion. </p>
<p><small>4
</small>How should we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land? <small>5 </small>If I forget thee, O 
Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <i>its skill</i>. <small>6
</small>May my tongue cleave to my throat, if I do not remember 
thee; if I do not prefer Jerusalem as the chief of my joy.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>Remember, O Lord, the 
children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase <i>it</i>, rase <i>it</i>, 
even to its foundations. <small>8 </small>Wretched daughter of Babylon! blessed <i>shall he be</i> who shall reward thee 
as thou hast rewarded us. <small>9 </small>Blessed <i>shall he be</i> who shall seize and dash thine infants against the 
rock.</p>
<h2>Psalm 138</h2>
<h4>A Psalm for David, of Aggaeus and Zacharias.</h4>
<p><small>138:1 </small>I will give thee thanks, O Lord, 
with my whole heart; and I will sing psalms to thee before the angels; for thou 
hast heard all the words of my mouth. <small>2 </small>
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and give thanks to thy name, on account 
of thy mercy and thy truth; for thou hast magnified thy holy name above every 
thing.
<small>3 </small>In whatsoever day I shall 
call upon thee, hear me speedily; thou shalt abundantly provide me with thy 
power in my soul. <small>4 </small>Let all the 
kings of the earth, o Lord, give thanks unto thee; for they have heard all the 
words of thy mouth. <small>5 </small>And let them 
sing in the ways of the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord.</p>

<p><small>6 </small>For the Lord is high, and <i>
yet</i> regards the lowly; and he knows high things from afar off. <small>7 </small>Though I should walk in the midst 
of affliction, thou wilt quicken me; thou hast stretched forth thine hands 
against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand has saved me. <small>8 </small>O Lord, thou shalt recompense <i>
them</i> on my behalf: thy mercy, O Lord, <i>endures</i> for ever: overlook not 
the works of thine hands.</p>
<h2>Psalm 139</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>139:1 </small>O Lord, thou hast proved me, and 
known me. <small>2
</small>Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising: 
thou understandest my thoughts long before. <small>3 </small>
Thou hast traced my path and my bed, and hast foreseen all my 
ways. <small>4 </small>For there is no unrighteous 
word in my tongue: behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things,
<small>5 </small>the last and the first: 
thou hast fashioned me, and laid thine hand upon me. </p>
<p><small>6
</small>The knowledge of thee is too wonderful for me; it 
is very difficult, I cannot <i>attain</i> to it.
<small>7 </small>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? 
and whither shall I flee from my presence? <small>8
</small>If I should go up to heaven, thou art there: if I should 
go down to hell, thou art present. <small>9 </small>
If I should spread my wings <i>to fly</i> straight 
forward, and sojourn at the extremity of the sea, <i>it would be vain</i>,
<small>10 </small>for even there thy hand would 
guide me, and thy right hand would hold me. <small>11
</small>When I said, Surely the darkness will cover me; 
even the night <i>was</i> light in my luxury. <small>12 </small>
For darkness will not be darkness with thee; but night 
will be light as day: as its darkness, so shall its light <i>be to thee</i>.
<small>13 </small>For thou, O Lord, hast possessed 
my reins; thou hast helped me from my mother’s womb. <small>14 </small>I will give thee thanks; for 
thou art fearfully wondrous; wondrous are thy works; and my soul knows <i>it</i> 
well. <small>15 </small>My bones, which 
thou madest in secret were not hidden from thee, nor my substance, in the lowest 
parts of the earth. <small>16 </small>Thine eyes saw my unwrought <i>substance</i>, and all <i>men</i> shall be 
written in thy book; they shall be formed by day, though <i>there should for a 
time</i> be no one among them.</p>

<p><small>17 </small>But thy friends, O God, 
have been greatly honoured by me; their rule has been greatly strengthened.
<small>18 </small>I will number them, and they 
shall be multiplied beyond the sand; I awake, and am still with thee.
</p>
<p><small>19 </small>Oh that thou wouldest 
slay the wicked, O God; depart from me, ye men of blood. <small>
20 </small>For thou wilt say concerning <i>their</i> 
thought, <i>that</i> they shall take thy cities in vain. <small>
21 </small>Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hate thee? 
and wasted away because of thine enemies? <small>22 </small>
I have hated them with perfect hatred; they were counted my 
enemies. <small>23 </small>Prove me, O God, and 
know my heart; examine me, and know my paths; <small>24
</small>and see if <i>there is any</i> way of iniquity in 
me, and lead me in an everlasting way.</p>
<h2>Psalm 140</h2>
<h4>For the end, a Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>140:1 </small>Rescue me, O Lord, from the evil 
man; deliver me from the unjust man. <small>2</small> 
Who have devised injustice in their hearts; all the day they prepared war. <small>
3 </small>They have sharpened their tongue as <i>the 
tongue</i> of a serpent; the poison of asps is under their lips. Pause. <small>4 </small>Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the 
sinner; rescue me from unjust men; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
<small>5 </small>The proud have hid a snare 
for me, and have stretched out ropes <i>for</i> snares for my feet; they set a 
stumbling-block for me near the path. Pause. </p>
<p><small>6 </small>
I said to the Lord, Thou art my God; hearken, O Lord, to the 
voice of my supplication. <small>7 </small>
O Lord God, the strength of my salvation; thou hast screened my head in the day 
of battle.
<small>8 </small>Deliver me not, O Lord, to 
the sinner, according to my desire: they have devised <i>mischief</i> against 
me; forsake me not, lest they should be exalted. Pause. </p>
<p><small>9
</small> <i>As for</i> the head of them that compass me, 
the mischief of their lips shall cover them. <small>10 </small>
Coals of fire shall fall upon them on the earth; and 
thou shalt cast them down in afflictions: they shall not bear up <i>under them</i>.
<small>11 </small>A talkative man shall not prosper 
on the earth: evils shall hunt the unrighteous man to destruction.
<small>12 </small>I know that the Lord will 
maintain the cause of the poor, and the right of the needy ones. <small>13 </small>Surely the righteous shall give thanks 
to thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.</p>
<h2>Psalm 141</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David.</h4>
<p><small>141:1 </small>O Lord, I have cried to thee; hear 
me: attend to the voice of my supplication, when I cry to thee. <small>2 </small>Let my 
prayer be set forth before thee as incense; the lifting up of my hands <i>as</i> 
an evening sacrifice. <small>3 </small>Set a watch, 
O Lord, on my mouth, and a strong door about by lips. <small>4 </small>Incline not my heart to evil things, to 
employ pretexts for sins, with me who work iniquity: and let me not unite with 
their choice ones.
<small>5 </small>The righteous shall chasten me with 
mercy, and reprove me: but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head: for yet 
shall my prayer also be in their pleasures. </p>
<p><small>6
</small>Their mighty ones have been swallowed up near the rock: 
they shall hear my words, for they are sweet. <small>7
</small>As a lump of earth is crushed upon the ground, our 
bones have been scattered by the <i>mouth of</i> the grave. <small>8 </small>For mine eyes are to thee, O Lord God: I 
have hoped in thee; take not away my life. <small>9 </small>
Keep me from the snare which they have set for me, and from the 
stumbling blocks of them that work iniquity. <small>10
</small>Sinners shall fall by their own net: I am alone until I 
shall escape.</p>
<h2>Psalm 142</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of instruction for 
David, when he was in the cave, —a Prayer.</h4>
<p><small>142:1 </small>I cried to the Lord with my voice; 
with my voice I made supplication to the Lord. <small>2 </small>I will pour out before him my 
supplication: I will declare before him mine affliction. <small>3
</small>When my spirit was fainting within me, then thou knewest my paths; in the very way wherein I was walking, they hid a snare for 
me.
<small>4 </small>I looked on <i>my</i> right 
hand, and behold, for there was none that noticed me; refuge failed me; and 
there was none that cared for my soul. <small>5 </small>
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said, Thou art my hope, my portion 
in the land of the living. <small>6 </small>
Attend to my supplication, for I am brought very low; deliver me 
from them that persecute me; for they are stronger than I. <small>7 </small>Bring my soul out of prison, that I may 
give thanks to thy name, O Lord; the righteous shall wait for me, until thou 
recompense me.</p>
<h2>Psalm 143</h2>
<h4>A Psalm of David, when his son 
pursued him.</h4>
<p><small>143:1 </small>O Lord, attend to my prayer: 
hearken to my supplication in thy truth; hear me in thy righteousness. <small>2 </small>
And enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy 
sight shall no <i>man</i> living be justified. </p>
<p><small>3 </small>
For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has brought my 
life down to the ground; he has made me to dwell in a dark <i>place</i>, as 
those that have been long dead. <small>4 </small>
Therefore my spirit was grieved in me; my heart was troubled within me.
<small>5 </small>I remembered the days of 
old; and I meditated on all thy doings: <i>yea</i>, I meditated on the works of 
thine hands. <small>6 </small>I spread 
forth my hands to thee; my soul <i>thirsts</i> for thee, as a dry land. Pause.</p>

<p><small>7 </small>Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit 
has failed; turn not away thy face from me, else I shall be like to them that go 
down to the pit. <small>8 </small>Cause me to hear 
thy mercy in the morning; for I have hoped in thee; make known to me, O Lord, 
the way wherein I should walk; for I have lifted up my soul to thee. <small>9 </small>
Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord; for I have fled to thee for refuge. <small>10
</small>Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God; thy 
good Spirit shall guide me in the straight <i>way</i>. <small>11
</small>Thou shalt quicken me, O Lord, for thy name’s 
sake; in thy righteousness thou shalt bring my soul out of affliction. <small>12 </small>And in thy mercy thou wilt destroy mine 
enemies, and wilt destroy all those that afflict my soul; for I am thy servant.</p>
<h2>Psalm 144</h2>
<h4><i>A Psalm</i> of David concerning 
Goliad.</h4>
<p><small>144:1 </small>Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord my God, who instructs my 
hands for battle, <i>and</i> my fingers for war. <small>2 </small>
My mercy, and my refuge; my helper, and my deliverer; my 
protector, in whom I have trusted; who subdues my people under me. </p>
<p>
<small>3 </small>Lord, what is man, that thou art 
made known to him? or the son of man, that thou takest account of him? <small>4 </small>Man is like to vanity: his days pass as a 
shadow. </p>
<p><small>5 </small>O Lord, bow thy heavens, 
and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
<small>6 </small>Send lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: send forth thine arrows, and thou shalt discomfit them.
<small>7 </small>Send forth thine hand from 
on high; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hand of 
strange children; <small>8 </small>whose mouth has 
spoken vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.</p>

<p><small>9 </small>O God, I will sing a new song to thee: 
I will play to thee on a psaltery of ten strings. <small>10 </small> <i>Even</i> to him who gives 
salvation to kings: who redeems his servant David from the hurtful sword. <small>11 </small>Deliver me, and rescue me from the hand 
of strange children, whose mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is a 
right hand of iniquity; <small>12 </small>
whose children are as plants, strengthened in their youth: their 
daughters are beautiful, sumptuously adorned after the similitude of a temple. <small>13 </small>
Their garners are full, and bursting with one kind of store after another; their 
sheep are prolific, multiplying in their streets. <small>14 </small>
Their oxen are fat: there is no falling down of a hedge, nor 
going out, nor cry in their folds. <small>15 </small>
Men bless the people to whom this lot belongs, <i>but</i> 
blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.</p>
<h2>Psalm 145</h2>
<h4>David’s <i>Psalm of</i> praise.</h4>
<p><small>145:1 </small>I will exalt thee, my God, my 
king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. <small>2 </small>
Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. <small>
3 </small>The Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; and there 
is no end to his greatness. <small>4 </small>
Generation after generation shall praise thy works, and tell of 
thy power. <small>5 </small>And they shall speak of 
the glorious majesty of thy holiness, and recount thy wonders. <small>6 </small>And they shall 
speak of the power of thy terrible <i>acts</i>; and recount thy greatness.
<small>7 </small>They shall utter the memory of the 
abundance of thy goodness, and shall exult in thy righteousness.
</p>
<p><small>8 </small>The Lord is compassionate, and 
merciful; long suffering, and abundant in mercy. <small>9
</small>The Lord is good to those that wait <i>on him</i>; 
and his compassions are over all his works.
<small>10 </small>Let all thy works, O Lord, give 
thanks to thee; and let thy saints bless thee. <small>11
</small>They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of 
thy dominion; <small>12 </small>to make known to 
the sons of men thy power, and the glorious majesty of thy kingdom. <small>13 </small>Thy kingdom is 
an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion <i>endures</i> through all generations. 
 
The Lord is faithful in his words, and holy in all his works. </p>
<p>
<small>14 </small>The Lord supports all that are falling, 
and sets up all that are broken down. <small>15 </small>
The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest <i>them</i> 
their food in due season. <small>16 </small>
Thou openest thine hands, and fillest every living thing with pleasure.
<small>17 </small>The Lord is righteous in all his 
ways, and holy in all his works. </p>
<p><small>18 </small>
The Lord is near to all that call upon him, to all that call upon 
him in truth. <small>19 </small>He will perform the 
desire of them that fear him: and he will hear their supplication, and save 
them. <small>20 </small>
The Lord preserves all that love him: but all sinners he will utterly destroy. <small>21 </small>
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy 
name for ever and ever.</p>
<h2>Psalm 146</h2>
<h4>Alleluia, <i>a Psalm</i>

<p><small>146:1 </small>My soul, praise the Lord. <small>2
</small>While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises 
to my God as long as I exist. <small>3 </small>
Trust not in princes, nor in the children of men, in whom there 
is no safety. <small>4 </small>His breath shall go 
forth, and he shall return to his earth; in that day all his thoughts shall 
perish.</p>

<p><small>5 </small>Blessed is he whose helper is the God 
of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God: <small>6
</small>who made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all things in 
them: who keeps truth for ever: <small>7 </small>
who executes judgment for the wronged: who gives food to the 
hungry. The Lord looses the fettered ones: <small>8 </small>
the Lord gives wisdom to the blind: 
</p>
<p>The Lord sets up the broken 
down: the Lord loves the righteous: the Lord preserves the strangers;
<small>9 </small>he will relieve the orphan and 
widow: but will utterly remove the way of sinners. <small>10
</small>The Lord shall reign for ever, <i>even</i> thy 
God, O Sion, to all generations.</p>
<h2>Psalm 147</h2>
<h4>Alleluia, <i>a Psalm</i>

<p><small>147:1 </small>Praise ye the Lord: for psalmody 
is a good thing; let praise be sweetly sung to our God. <small>2 </small>
The Lord builds up Jerusalem; and he will gather together the 
dispersed of Israel. <small>3 </small>He heals the 
broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. <small>4
</small>He numbers the multitudes of stars; and calls them all by 
names. <small>5 </small>Great is our Lord, and 
great is his strength; and his understanding is infinite. <small>6 </small>The Lord lifts up the meek; but brings 
sinners down to the ground. </p>
<p><small>7 </small>
Begin <i>the song</i> with thanksgiving to the Lord; sing 
praises on the harp to our God: <small>8 </small>
who covers the heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who causes 
grass to spring up on the mountains, [and green herb for the service of men;] <small>9 </small>
and gives cattle their food, and to the young ravens that call upon him. <small>10
</small>He will not take pleasure in the strength of a horse; 
neither is he well-pleased with the legs of a man. <small>
11 </small>The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, and in 
all that hope in his mercy.</p>
<p>Alleluia, a Psalm of 
Aggaeus and Zacharias.</p>
<p><small>12 </small>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Sion.
<small>13 </small>For he has strengthened the bars 
of thy gates; he has blessed thy children within thee. <small>14
</small>He makes thy borders peaceful, and fills thee with the 
flour of wheat. <small>15 </small>He sends his 
oracle to the earth: his word will run swiftly. <small>16 </small>
He gives snow like wool: he scatters the mist like ashes. <small>17 </small>Casting <i>forth</i> his ice like 
morsels: who shall stand before his cold? <small>18 </small>
He shall send out his word, and melt them: he shall blow <i>with</i> 
his wind, and the waters shall flow. <small>19 </small>
He sends his word to Jacob, his ordinances and judgments to 
Israel. <small>20 </small>He has not done so to any
<i>other</i> nation; and he has not shewn them his judgments.</p>

<h2>Psalm 148</h2>
<h4>Alleluia, <i>a Psalm</i> of 
Aggaeus and Zacharias.</h4>
<p><small>148:1 </small>Praise ye the Lord from the 
heavens: praise him in the highest. <small>2 </small>Praise ye him, all his 
angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. <small>3 </small>
Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars and light.
<small>4 </small>Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, 
and the water that is above the heavens. <small>5 </small>
Let them praise the name of the Lord: for he spoke, and they were 
made; he commanded, and they were created. <small>6 </small>
He has established them for ever, even for ever and ever: he has 
made an ordinance, and it shall not pass away.</p>

<p><small>7 </small> Praise the Lord from the earth, ye 
serpents, and all deeps. <small>8 </small>Fire, 
hail, snow, ice, stormy wind; the things that perform his word. <small>9 </small>Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, 
and all cedars: <small>10 </small>wild beasts, and 
all cattle; reptiles, and winged birds: <small>11 </small>
kings of the earth, and all peoples; princes, and all judges of 
the earth: <small>12 </small>young men and virgins, 
old men with youths: <small>13 </small>let them 
praise the name of the Lord: for his name only is exalted; his praise is above 
the earth and heaven, <small>14 </small>and he 
shall exalt the horn of his people, <i>there is</i> a hymn for all his saints,
<i>even</i> of the children of Israel, a people who draw near to him.</p>
<h2>Psalm 149</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>149:1 </small>Sing to the Lord a new song: his 
praise is in the assembly of the saints. <small>2
</small>Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; and let the 
children of Sion exult in their king. <small>3 </small>
Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sings praises to 
him with timbrel and psaltery. <small>4 </small>For 
the Lord takes pleasure in his people; and will exalt the meek with salvation.
</p>
<p><small>5 </small>The saints shall rejoice in glory; 
and shall exult on their beds.
<small>6 </small> The high praises of God shall be in 
their throat, and two-edged swords in their hands; <small>7
</small>to execute vengeance on the nations, <i>and</i> 
punishments among the peoples; <small>8 </small>to 
bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with manacles of iron; <small>9 </small>to execute on them the judgment written: 
this honour have all his saints.</p>
<h2>Psalm 150</h2>
<h4>Alleluia.</h4>
<p><small>150:1 </small>Praise God in his holy places: 
praise him in the firmament of his power. <small>2
</small>Praise him on <i>account of</i> his mighty acts: praise 
him according to his abundant greatness. <small>3 </small>
Praise him with the sound of a trumpet: praise him with psaltery 
and harp. <small>4 </small>Praise him with timbrel 
and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and the organ. <small>5 </small>Praise him with melodious cymbals: praise 
him with loud cymbals. <small>6 </small>Let every 
thing that has breath praise the Lord.</p>

<h2>Psalm 151</h2>
<h4>This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though supernumerary, composed when he fought in single combat with 
Goliad.</h4>

<p> <small>151:1 </small>I was small among my brethren, and youngest in my father’s 
house: I tended my father’s sheep.  <small>2 </small>My hands formed a musical instrument, 
and my fingers tuned a psaltery.  <small>3 </small>And who shall tell my Lord? the Lord 
himself, he himself hears.  <small>5 </small>He sent forth his angel, and took me from my 
father’s sheep, and he anointed me with the oil of his anointing.  <small>5 </small>My 
brothers were handsome and tall; but the Lord did not take pleasure in them. 
<small>6 </small>I went forth to meet the Philistine; and he cursed me by his idols. 
<small>7 </small>But I drew his own sword, and beheaded him, and removed reproach from 
the children of Israel.</p>
